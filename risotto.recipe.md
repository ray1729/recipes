# Risotto

Recipe yields 2 portions 

### Ingredients
 * 100 grams arborio rice
 * 100 grams carnaroli rice
 * 50 milliliters dry white wine
 * 400 milliliters vegetable stock
 * 25 grams onion, chopped
 * 50 grams unsalted butter
 * 25 grams parmesan cheese, grated
 * salt
 * pepper

### Directions

Melt 25g of the butter in a heavy-based pan; add the chopped onion and cook without colour until softened.

Add the rice and continue to cook for 2 miniutes.

Add the dry white wine and reduce to a glaze.

Add the stock a little at a time, adding more when the last has evaporated. 

When cooked, all the stock should be absorbed into the rice, and the risotto should have a rice pudding consistency (about 20 minutes total cooking time).

Finally mix in the parmesan cheese and the rest of the rock-hard butter off the heat, season and serve.

Many different flavours may be added to the basic risotto and different stocks used to suit the dish (e.g. fish stock for a seafood risotto).
