# Grilled Lamb Kofta Kebabs

### Ingredients
 * 500 grams Lamb (shoulder, breast, leg, neck fillets), diced
 * fresh thyme
 * fresh rosemary
 * Summer savoury
 * 1 teaspoons chilli powder
 * 0.5 teaspoons ground cumin
 * 1 teaspoons sumaq
 * salt
 * pepper
 * pistachio nuts, shelled
 * 1 pieces Red onions, thinly sliced
 * salt
 * 0.5 pieces lemon, juice
 * fresh parsley
 * salad leaves
 * fresh mint
 * olive oil
 * yoghurt

### Directions

Trim any sinew from the lamb, then place in a food processor with the fresh herbs, spices, and pistachio nuts.  Pulse a few times to get a course mixture.

Press a handful at a time onto skewers, then refrigerate for 2 hours.

Drizzle with olive oil and cook on a hot grill or griddle pan for 3-4 minutes, turning once during cooking.

To serve, sprinkle salt and lemon juice over onions and mix with the parsley.  Toss with the salad leaves, mint and a drizzle of olive oil.  Break up the kebab and sprinkle with more spices, fresh thyme leaves and a spoonful of yoghurt.  Serve wrapped in a flat bread.
