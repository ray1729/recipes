### Directions

To make the sponge: dissolve the yeast in the water, add the flours and mix to a soft sponge.  Put into a bowl with plenty of room for expansion (up to 3 times), cover with a plastic lid (or clingfilm) and leave to ferment for 16-48 hours.

To make the dough, mix all the ingredients together and knead until the dough is fairly stretchy and silky.  Cover and allow to prove for 1 hour.

Shape into loaves or rolls and bake at 220°C for 10 minutes then reduce temperature to 190°C to finish cooking (another 5 minutes or so for rolls, 20-30 minutes for small loaves).
