# Winter Vegetable Crumble

Recipe yields 4 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 500 milliliters cider
 * 200 milliliters vegetable stock
 * 1 teaspoons brown sugar
 * 2 pieces carrots, peeled and sliced
 * 2 pieces parsnips, peeled and sliced
 * 2 sticks celery, chopped
 * 1 heads broccoli, cut into florets
 * 1 pieces cauliflower, cut into florets
 * 25 grams butter
 * 1 pieces onion, finely chopped
 * 15 grams plain flour
 * 4 pieces tomatoes, peeled and chopped
 * 200 grams black-eye beans, cooked
 * 200 grams butter beans, cooked
 * 200 grams haricot beans, cooked
 * 1 bunches parsley, chopped
 * salt
 * pepper
 * 75 grams butter
 * 100 grams wholemeal flour
 * 50 grams rolled oats
 * 100 grams strong cheddar cheese, grated
 * 0.5 teaspoons salt

### Directions

Combine the cider, vegetable stock, sugar and a good pinch of salt and cook the carrots, parsnips and celery until tender (10-15 minutes). Lift out of the stock with a slotted spoon and set aside.

Bring the stock back to the boil and add the broccoli and cauliflower. Cook for 5-10 minutes, then lift out of the stock and set aside with the carrots and parsnips, reserving the cooking liquor.

Melt the butter and cook the onion gently, without colouring. Sprinkle in the flour and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring well. Gradually add the cooking liquor, stirring until smooth after each addition. Bring to a boil and simmer gently until the sauce thickens.

Pour the sauce over the vegetables, add the cooked beans and tomatoes, sprinkle over the parsley and stir gently to combine. Season to taste, then spoon into a shallow oven-proof dish.

To make the crumble topping, rub the butter into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs, then stir in the salt, oats, and cheese.

Sprinkle the topping evenly over the vegetables, transfer to a pre-heated 200â„ƒ oven and cook until golden, 30-35 minutes.

Notes:

This is a flexible dish, and any of the vegetables may be mixed and matched depending on what you have to hand. Turnips and swedes work well, so it's a great way to use up a surplus of root vegetables.

If you are using dried beans, follow the soaking and cooking instructions on the packet - you may need to soak overninght and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, so this is something to prepare ahead. Of course, ready-cooked beans from a tin are fine, but rinse them well to get rid of the salt/sugar solution they might be packed in.
