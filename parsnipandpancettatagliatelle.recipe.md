# Parsnip and pancetta tagliatelle

Recipe yields 2 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 8 slices pancetta
 * 2 tablespoons olive oil
 * 2 sprigs rosemary
 * 1 cloves garlic
 * 2 pieces parsnips
 * parmesan cheese, grated
 * 1 tablespoons butter

### Directions

Cook tagliatelle in a large pan of boiling water.

Heat oil in a pan, add pancetta and rosemary.  Peel and slice garlic, add to the pan and toss around.

Peel parsnips, discarding the skin.  Using the peeler, peel off thin strips of parsnip, stopping when you get to the core (which can be discarded).

Once the pancetta is crispy, toss in the parsnip strips and heat through for about 1 minute.

Remove from the heat then add the tagliatelle, grated parmesan, a large knob of butter, and season generously with freshly ground black pepper.  Add a couple of tablespoons of cooking liquor from the tagliatelle.  Serve immediately.
