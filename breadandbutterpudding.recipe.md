# Bread and butter pudding

### Ingredients
 * 3 slices white bread
 * 30 grams butter, softened
 * 1 tablespoons currants
 * 1 tablespoons sultanas
 * 2 teaspoons chopped mixed peel
 * 2 pieces eggs
 * 1 pieces egg yolk
 * 1 tablespoons sugar, heaped
 * 290 milliliters creamy milk
 * vanilla extract
 * ground cinnamon
 * demerera sugar

### Directions

Remove the crusts from the bread, spread with the butter and cut into quarters.  Arrange half of the bread in a shallow, buttered ovenproof dish, buttered side up, and sprinkle with the currants, sultanas and mixed peel.  Cover with the remaining bread.

Mix the eggs and egg yolk with the sugar and stir in the milk and vanilla extract.

Strain the custard carefully over the bread.  Place in the refrigerator and leave to soak for 30 minutes.  Sprinkle with the cinnamon and demerera sugar.

Preheat the oven to 170C, gas 3.  Place the pudding in a roasting pan half-filled with hot water and cook in the middle of the oven for about 45 minutes, until the custard is set and the top is brown and crusty.
