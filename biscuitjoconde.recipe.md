# Biscuit Joconde

Recipe yields 900 grams 

### Ingredients
 * 185 grams ground almonds
 * 185 grams icing sugar
 * 5 pieces eggs
 * 5 pieces egg whites
 * 25 grams sugar
 * 50 grams butter
 * 50 grams plain flour

### Directions

Preheat the oven to 250C.

Place the eggs, icing sugar and ground almonds in the bowl of a mixer and beat at high speed for about 10 minutes, until the mixture forms a ribbon.  Pour into a bowl and set aside.  Beat the egg whites until well risen, then add the sugar and beat faster for 1 minute.  Fold the cooled butter, then the flour, into the egg mixture.  Mix in 1/3 of the egg whites until thouroughly blended, then fold in the rest, taking care not to overmix.

Using a palette knife, spread the mixture over a sheet of baking parchment, to a thickness of 3-4mm (about 40cm x 60cm).  Bake immediately in the hot oven for 2-3 minutes.  To test whether the sponge is cooked, touch it with your fingertips - it should not stick to your fingers but be just firm, yet moist and on no account dry.

Slide the cooked sponge, still on the paper, onto a wire rack.  Remove the paper only just before using.
