# Pâte à Bombe

### Ingredients
 * 8 pieces egg yolk
 * 150 milliliters cold water
 * 200 grams caster sugar

### Directions

Whisk together egg yolks, water and sugar in a heatproof bowl.  Sit over a pan of barely simmering water and cook, stirring frequently, until a wooden spoon will stand upright in the mixture (up to an hour).

Remove the bowl from the heat, allow the mixture to cool slightly, then rub through a fine sieve with the back of a spoon.  Beat with an electric whisk until it is cool and has become light and fluffy.
