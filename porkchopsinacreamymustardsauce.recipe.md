# Pork chops in a creamy mustard sauce

Recipe yields 2 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 1 tablespoons oil
 * 2 pieces pork chops
 * 150 milliliters dry cider
 * 1 dessert spoons hot mustard
 * 1 dessert spoons wholegrain mustard
 * 2 tablespoons double cream
 * 1 sprigs thyme
 * salt
 * black pepper, fresh ground

### Directions

Heat a frying pan over a medium hear and add the oil.  When hot, add the chops and fry them for about 10 minutes, turning once or twice, until cooked through and browning nicely.  Transfer to a warm plate.  Pour the cider into the pan, scrape up any bits of caramelised pork stuck to the bottom, and let the liquid bubble and reduce by about half.  Stir in the mustard, cream and thyme, then return the chops to the pan.  Leave to simmer for a minute or two, so the sauce reduces a bit more, spooning some of it over the chops as it cooks.  Season to taste then serve right away with plain boiled potatoes and some shredded greens or cabbage.
