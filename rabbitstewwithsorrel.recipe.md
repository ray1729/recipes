 * 3 tablespoons flour
 * 2 teaspoons salt
 * 2 teaspoons milled white pepper
 * 75 grams unsalted butter
 * 2 tablespoons olive oil
 * 1 pieces onion
 * 3 cloves garlic
 * 2 pieces celery branches
 * 2 pieces carrots

 * thyme

### Directions

Chop – or ask the butcher to – the rabbit into six pieces. Cut the legs off at the back of the saddle then chop down the middle to separate the two legs, cut the forequarter section away from the saddle, split this in half and then halve the remaining saddle. Toss the rabbit pieces in three tbsp of flour seasoned with two tsp of salt and two tsp of milled white pepper. Dust off any excess flour.

Heat a third of the butter with two tbsp of olive oil and fry the rabbit pieces to a rich golden brown on both sides. Meanwhile, peel and slice the onion, garlic, celery and carrots. Heat a deep casserole dish, add another third of the butter and the sliced vegetables, allowing them to colour a little. Add the rabbit pieces to the casserole. Pour out the fat from the frying pan and add the cider, scraping up the caramelised juices, then add to the rabbit and vegetables. Add the stock and the herbs and bring to the boil. Skim and reduce to a very gentle simmer for an hour and a half.

Whilst the rabbit cooks, soak the button onions in lukewarm water for half an hour and then peel carefully. Melt the last third of butter in the (cleaned) frying pan and add the onions. Add a teaspoon of sugar and a couple of pinches of salt. Allow the onions to caramelise gently before covering with cold water and a buttered paper, letting them cook and the water slowly evaporate until the onions are tender and coated in a syrupy glaze. Roll the sorrel leaves into two or three cigars and then slice into fine ribbons. Turn up the heat in the frying pan and let the sorrel wilt around the onions while adding the juice of a lemon.

Once the rabbit pieces are tender, add them to the onions and sorrel. Strain the sauce from the rabbit into another saucepan and reduce. Serve with mashed potatoes.
