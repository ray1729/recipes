Cut the tips from the asparagus, blanch in boiling salted water and immediately refresh in an ice bath.

Thinly slice the aparagus stems. Blanch until tender in boiling salted water, then liquidize in a blender with ice cubes. Pass through a fine sieve.

To serve: reheat the soup, season with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Whisk in cubes of ice-cold butter just before serving.

Brush the scallops with a little oil, season, and sautée in a hot pan until nicely coloured and cooked through.

Reheat the asparagus tips by dropping into a pan of boiling salted water.

To serve: spoon some of the purée into a bowl, arrange 3 scallops and asparagus tips on top. Rush to the table.
