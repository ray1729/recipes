# Mushroom Nut Roast

Danna's mother's mushroom nut roast, by way of Lalli.

### Ingredients

* 1 large onion, diced
* 1 cup grated cheese (we use cheddar)
* 1 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans)
* 4 beaten eggs
* 1/4 lb melted butter (oil would be fine too)
* 4 slices of bread (I like really hearty sprouted wheat bread)
* herbs: parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme, or variants thereof
* 1 lb mushrooms, coarsely chopped
* 1/4 cup water
* 1/4 cup soy sauce

#### For the gravy

* onions (at least one)
* mushrooms (portabella or baby bella are best)
* 4 Tbsp butter (olive oil would probably work, but I've never tried)
* 1/4 cup flour (Might use less - maybe 2 TA)
* 1/2 cup sherry or marsala (other flavored liquids would work, but these have the best flavor here)
* 2 - 4 cups liquid (ideally vegetable broth - I use water)

#### Optional extras:

* garlic (as much as you like)
* thyme, dried or fresh
* paprika
* fresh parsley

### Directions

Mix all ingredients apart from water and soy sauce in a bowl, then transfer to a buttered/oiled casserole dish.
Baked at 350F (gas mark 4) for 20 minutes, then add the water and soy sauce and bake for a further 20 minutes.

#### For the gravy

You'll need two pans. First you saute onions, garlic and mushrooms in one. Add sherry and liquid etc. Then make the roux in the second. Then add the first pan to the second pan.
