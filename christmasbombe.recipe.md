# Christmas bombe

Recipe yields 700 ml 

### Ingredients
 * 125 grams Mixed raisins, sultanas, currants
 * 50 grams Glace cherries
 * 25 grams Mixed peel
 * 2 pieces oranges, zest only
 * 1 teaspoons Molasses
 * 3 teaspoons mixed spice
 * 2 tablespoons Brandy
 * 4 tablespoons Port
 * 300 milliliters milk
 * 4 pieces eggs, separated
 * 75 grams Dark Muscavado sugar
 * 300 milliliters Whipping cream
 * 75 grams raisins
 * 3 tablespoons Brandy
 * 1 sprigs Holly

### Directions

Place the fruit, cherries, peel, orange zest, molasses, spice, brandy  
and port into a bowl and leave to soak overnight.

Make a custard with the milk, egg yolks and muscavado sugar and leave  
until cold.  Mix the cream and egg whites, which have been lightly  
beaten, into the cold custard and pour into your ice-cream maker.   
Add the contents of the bowl to the ice cream maker either in the  
machine just as it finishes making, or by stirring it into the ice  
cream just after you have taken it from the machine.  Put the  
finished ice cream into a pudding bowl and store it in the freezer.

TO SERVE:

Put the raisins in to soak, preferably overnight, in the brandy.   
Turn the bombe onto a serving plate and decorate by sticking the  
raisins all over the outside.  Finish with a sprig of holly.
