Recipe yields 6 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 225 grams self-raising flour
 * 1 teaspoons baking powder
 * salt
 * 1 pieces lemon, finely grated zest
 * 1 pieces orange, finely grated zest
 * 150 grams beef suet
 * 150 grams vegetarian suet
 * 150 milliliters milk
 * 175 grams strawberry jam

### Directions

Sift together self-raising flour, baking powder and salt.  Add lemon zest and suet, and work to a fine breadcrumb consistency.

Add the milk a little at a time until a soft, but not sticky, dough is formed.  Wrap in cling film and rest 30 minutes.

Roll into a 20cm x 30cm rectangle.  Spread with jam, leaving a 1cm border.  Moisten border with milk, then roll, pinching at either end to seal in the jam.

Wrap loosely in greaseproof paper, then tin foil, and tie at either end.
