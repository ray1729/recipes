# Cherry Trifle

This can be made with any soft fruits that are in season or apples cooked down to a puree. You might need to vary the amount of sugar you add depending on the sweetness of the fruit. You can also change the alcohol according to the fruit: sweet sherry works with anything; creme de mure for a blackberry trifle; Calvados for an apple trifle, etc.

### Ingredients

#### For the sponge

 * 2 eggs
 * 55 g caster sugar
 * 1 tbsp boiling water
 * pinch salt
 * 55 g plain flour

 * 50 ml kirsch
 
#### For the fruit

 * 50 g sugar
 * 50 ml water
 * 500 g cherries, stones removed
 
#### For the custard

 * 300 ml double cream
 * 200 ml milk
 * 1 vanilla pod, split lenthwise and seeds scraped
 * 4 egg yolks
 * 60 g sugar
 * 20 g corn flour
 
#### For the Chantilly cream

 * 300 ml double cream
 * 50 g sugar
 * 1 tsp vanilla extract

#### For the topping

 * 50 g flaked almonds
 * splash kirsch
 * 1 tbsp icing sugar

### Directions

#### Sponge

Pre-heat the oven to 180C. Grease and line a round cake tin as close in size to your serving bowl as you can find.

Whisk together the eggs, sugar, and hot water until tripled in volume. Sift in the flour and salt, and fold in gently with a slotted metal spoon.

Gently pour the mixture into the prepared tin, smooth the top, and bake for 30 minutes. A skewer inserted into the middle of the cake should come out clean when it's done.

Cool in the tin for 10 minutes then remove to a cooling tray.

#### Fruit compote

Put the water and sugar into a pan, heat gently until the sugar has dissolved, then simmer for 3-5 minutes until a syrupy consistency. Add the fruit and cook until it bursts and gives up its juice. Set aside to cool.

For an apple trifle, it's nice to use a mix of cooking apples (that cook down to a pulp) and some finely diced dessert apples that will keep their shape.

#### Custard

Put the milk, cream, and vanilla pod and seeds into a pan and heat until steaming. Leave to infuse for 30 minutes.

Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, and cornflour. Slowly pour the infused milk mixture onto the yolks, stirring all the time. Return to the pan and cook until thickened. Remove the vanilla pod.

Set aside to cool.

#### Chantilly Cream

Whisk together the cream, sugar, and vanilla to a soft peaks consistency.

#### Toasted Almonds

Spread the almonds in a single layer in a baking tray, sprinkle over the kirsch, then sift over the icing sugar. Bake in a 180C oven for around 10 minutes then set aside to cool.

#### Assembly

Trifle is usually served in a decorative glass bowl. Begin by placing your sponge cake into the base of the bowl, then sprinkle over the alcohol.

Next spoon in the fruit compote, followed by the custard. It's okay to complete these stages while the ingredients are slightly warm, but it must be completely cooled before you add the cream.

Once completely cool, spoon over the Chantilly cream then sprinkle with the toasted almonds.
