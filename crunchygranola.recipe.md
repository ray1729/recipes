# Crunchy Granola

### Ingredients
 * 6 cups rolled oats
 * 2 cups mixed nuts and seeds
 * 1 cups Desiccated coconut
 * 1 teaspoons ground cinnamon
 * salt
 * 1 cups honey
 * 1 cups raisins

### Directions

 1. Preheat oven to 180Â°C. In a bowl, combine oats, nuts and seeds, coconut, cinnamon, salt and honey. Place on a sheet pan and put in oven. Bake for 30 minutes or a little longer, stirring occasionally. Mixture should brown evenly; the browner it gets without burning, the crunchier the granola will be.
 
2. Remove pan from oven and add raisins or dried fruit. Cool on a rack, stirring once in a while until granola reaches room temperature. Transfer to a sealed container and store in refrigerator; it will keep indefinitely.
