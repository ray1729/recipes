# Slow roasted pork butt

Recipe yields 9 portions 

### Ingredients
 * 1 teaspoons fennel seeds
 * 1 teaspoons black peppercorns
 * 1 teaspoons chilli powder
 * 0.25 cups coarse salt
 * 0.25 cups brown sugar
 * 3 kilograms pork butt
 * 3 kilograms pork shoulder
 * 0.25 cups cider vinegar
 * 0.25 cups soft brown sugar

### Directions

Crush fennel seeds and black peppercorns and mix with the chilli powder, sugar and salt. Rub the pork with the dry mix and refrigerate overnight.

Pre-heat oven to 160C (140C fan). Rinse off the rub and place pork into a roasting tin with 1 cup boiling water. Cover with tin foil and seal the edges. Cook for 5 1/2 hours.

Remove from the oven and increase temperature to 220C (200C fan). Remove foil from the roasting tin and stir cider vinegar and sugar into roasting juices. Return to the oven for 10 minutes to brown. 

Pour liquid into a small saucepan, skim off fat, and reduce to a sticky consistency. Meanwhile shred the meat with two forks. Pour over the glaze and toss.
