# Ginger ice cream

Recipe yields 4 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 500 milliliters milk
 * 250 milliliters double cream
 * 1 teaspoons ground ginger
 * 2 pieces vanilla pods, split and scraped
 * 6 pieces egg yolks
 * 100 grams caster sugar
 * 100 grams stem ginger (in syrup from a jar), diced

### Directions

Place the milk, cream, ginger powder and vanilla pods in a pan and heat gently over a low heat until it starts to steam, without even reaching a simmer.  Remove from the heat and leave for 15 minutes to infuse.

Place the egg yolks in a bowl with the sugar, vanilla seeds and stem ginger (and a little of the ginger syrup if you like), and whisk really well for 3-4 minutes.  Pour in the infused milk and whisk well for 1 minute.

Place back in the pan over a gentle heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, for 5-8 minutes until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Pour this through a sieve into a clean bowl straightaway to cool down.  Leave at room temperature for 5 minutes, stirring now and again, then place in the fridge to cool.

Place the cooled custard mixture in an ice-cream machine to churn and set.  Keep in the freezer until required.
