# Saddle of lamb with apricot and cumin stuffing

Recipe yields 6 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 1.3 kilograms saddle of lamb, skinned and boned
 * 2 tablespoons cumin seeds
 * sea salt
 * black pepper, fresh ground
 * 20 slices parma ham
 * olive oil
 * 150 grams apricots, soaked overnight
 * 30 grams pine nuts, toasted
 * 25 grams fresh breadcrumbs
 * 1 tablespoons olive oil

### Directions

Trim off the excess fillets from the saddle of lambso that you can roll it into a neat log.  Toast the cumin seeds in a hot dry pan then grind them coarsely in a pestle and mortar with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper.  Rub half over the lamb.

Finely chop the apricots and pine nuts then tip into a bowl.  Stir in the breadcrumbs, olive oil, some salt and pepper and the rest of the cumin.

On a large sheet of cling film, arrange all but two of the slices of parma ham in a rectangle, overlapping slightly.  Lay the lamb, opened out like a butterfly, on top of the Parma ham.  Season the lamb and pile the stuffing in a neat row along the centre (you may not need all of it).  Fold the sides of the lamb over the stuffing, wrap in the Parma ham  and outer cling film, then chill for an hour to set.

Heat the oven to 180C/gas 4.  Remove the cling film.  Use the remaining 2 slices of Parma ham to cover the two ends and secure the stuffing.  Tie the log with string at 2-3cm intervals, just firmly enough to hold it together during roasting.

Heat a little olive oil in a wide ovenproof frying pan until hot, then sear the lamb for 2-3 minutes on each side until browned.  Place seam-side down in the pan and transfer to the pre-heated oven.  Roast for 35-40 minutes, turing the lamb and basting half-way through cooking.  Rest in a warm place for 10-15 minutes, then slice thickly and serve with the pan juices and accompaniments.
