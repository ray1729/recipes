# Penne with goat's cheese and ruby chard

### Ingredients
 * 1 bunches ruby chard
 * 1.5 pieces onions, thinly sliced
 * 2 tablespoons olive oil
 * salt
 * pepper
 * 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
 * 5 ounces creamy white goat's cheese
 * 1 pounds penne pasta
 * 0.5 cups white wine
 * 0.75 cups toasted pine nuts

### Directions

Wash chard thoroughly. Cut off and discard thick stems. Remove the center ribs and chop, then chop the leaves and put aside separately.

Put the pasta on to boil. 

Saute the onions in the olive oil for about 2 minutes. Then add the chard ribs, and saute together for about 5 minutes more or until the ribs are somewhat tender. 

Add the remaining chard with a tiny bit of salt, and toss until chard is wilted. Add the vinegar and stir thoroughly to combine. Add the white wine, stir, and turn off heat. This should be right about the time the pasta is finished cooking. 

Drain the pasta, crumble the goat cheese over the pasta, then add the chard mixture and mix it all together well. 

Serve immediately, garnished with toasted pine nuts if desired.
