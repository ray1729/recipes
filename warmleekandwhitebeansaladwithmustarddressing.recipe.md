# Warm leek and white bean salad with mustard dressing

Recipe yields 4 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 2 tablespoons olive oil
 * 2 large leeks, trimmed
 * 2 large leeks, finely sliced
 * salt
 * black pepper, freshly ground
 * 410 grams tinned cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
 * 1 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley, chopped
 * salad leaves
 * 1 tablespoons Dijon mustard
 * 1 tablespoons wholegrain mustard
 * 3 tablespoons olive oil
 * 2 teaspoons cider vinegar
 * salt
 * pepper
 * sugar

### Directions

Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, then add the leeks and a generous pinch of seasoning.  As soon as the leeks begin to soften, turn down the heat to fairly low and carry on cooking, stirring from time to time, until the leeks are very soft (take care that they don't take on any colour).

Add the rinsed white beans and parsley, and toss them with the leeks until heated through and nicely combined.  Turn off the heat.

Whisk together the ingredients for the dressing, add to the pan and stir.  Divide the salad leaves between four plates and add the warm leek and bean mixture,  Serve straight away with toasted bread.
