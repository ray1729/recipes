# Milk, honey and whisky jelly

### Ingredients
 * 350 milliliters milk
 * 350 milliliters cream
 * 4 tablespoons glucose syrup
 * 10 tablespoons honey
 * 100 milliliters whisky, alcohol burned off
 * 8 pieces gelatine leaves

### Directions

Combine milk, cream, glucose syrup, honey and whisky.  Check taste, add more honey/glucose if required.

Soak the gelatine leaves in cold water.  Warm a ladle or two of the milky mixture in a small pan.  Squeeze out the gelatine leaves and whisk into the warmed milk.  Whisk this into the bulk of the mixture.  Pour into a mould and refrigerate to set.

[This was served with a white sponge in the bottom of a terrine mould, a layer of fig pur√©e, then a thin layer of jelly set.  A row of topped-and-tailed figs were set down the middle, encased in the rest of the jelly.]
