# Michael Smith's cauliflower soup

### Ingredients
 * 1 medium cauliflower
 * 600 milliliters chicken stock
 * 600 milliliters milk
 * 60 grams butter
 * 30 grams plain flour
 * salt
 * nutmeg
 * 4 pieces eggs

### Directions

Cut the stalk from the cauliflower and divide the head into fingertip-sized florets.  Poach them in boiling chicken stock for about 7 minutes, until cooked but still firm.  Remove them from the pan with a slotted spoon and put to one side.  Add the milk to the pan and bring to the boil.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in another pan, stir in the flour and cook for 2 minutes.  Gradually whisk in the liquid, then simmer for 5 minutes.  Strain this into the original (rinsed out) pan, add the cauliflower florets, and reheat gently.  Season to taste with salt and nutmeg.

Put a poached or lightly-boiled egg into each plate and pour over the soup.  Serve with a bowl of crispy, fried bread cubes on the side.
