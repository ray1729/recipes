### Ingredients
 * 1 kilograms pumpkin, peeled and deseeded
 * 1 kilograms butternut squash, peeled and deseeded
 * 1 tablespoons vegetable oil
 * 1 pieces onion, peeled and diced
 * 2.5 centimetres fresh root ginger, peeled
 * 2.5 centimetres fresh root ginger, finely chopped
 * 4 tablespoons red Thai curry paste
 * 450 milliliters vegetable stock
 * 400 milliliters coconut milk (canned)
 * 142 milliliters single cream
 * 20 grams fresh basil, chopped

### Directions

Preheat the oven to 180C.  Cut the pumpkin into 1cm cubes, place on a non-stick baking tray, season and roast for 30 minutes or until tender.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a medium pan and add the onion and ginger. Cover and sauté for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the curry paste and cook for 1-2 minutes, then add the pumpkin, stock and coconut milk. Cover and bring to the boil, then allow to simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.

Purée the soup in a food processor or blender in 2 batches, until smooth. Return to the pan, season to taste and reheat gently, adding a little more stock or boiling water for a thinner consistency if required.

Place the cream and chopped basil in a small pan and heat gently. Serve the soup in bowls with the basil cream swirled over the top and sprinkled with freshly ground black pepper, and with crusty granary bread on the side.
