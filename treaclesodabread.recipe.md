# Treacle Soda Bread

### Ingredients

  * 250 g wholemeal flour
  * 200 g self-raising flour
  * 50 g pinhead oats
  * 13 g fine salt
  * 6 g bicarbonate of soda
  * 2 g baking powder
  * 90 g black treacle
  * 200 g oat or soya yogurt
  * 250 g oat milk

### Directions

Mix all the dry ingredients together in one large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the yogurt, oat milk and treacle until combined.

Mix the wet and dry mixes together to a smooth dough.

Grease work bench with a few drops of oil to prevent the dough sticking. Turn out dough onto the bench and roll into the length of your bread tin.

Place dough into tin and sprinkle a generous layer of oats on the top.

Cook at 180C for 30 minutes until golden. Once golden, remove from the tin and on a tray, bake for a further five minutes to colour the edges/bottom of the loaf.

Allow to cool on a wire rack before slicing.
