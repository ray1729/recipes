# Gingernuts

Recipe yields 24 biscuits 

### Ingredients
 * 30 grams demerera sugar
 * 55 grams butter
 * 85 grams golden syrup
 * 115 grams plain flour
 * 0.5 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda
 * 1.25 teaspoons ground ginger

### Directions

Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.  Grease a baking sheet.

Melt the sugar, butter and syrup together slowly, without boiling.  Make sure the sugar has dissolved then remove from the heat and allow to cool.

Sift the flour with the bicarbonate of soda and ginger into a bowl, make a well in the centre, and pour in the melted mixture.  Knead until smooth.

Roll into balls and flatten on the greased baking sheet, into biscuits about 3.5cm in diameter.

Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack.
