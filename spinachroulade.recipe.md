# Spinach Roulade

### Ingredients
 * 1 pieces onion, finely chopped
 * 225 grams fresh spinach, stemmed and shredded
 * 25 grams butter
 * 2 tablespoons parsley, chopped
 * salt
 * pepper
 * nutmeg
 * 4 pieces eggs
 * 50 grams wholemeal flour
 * 225 grams cottage cheese
 * chives

### Directions

Melt the butter and cook the onion until soft but not coloured. Add the spinach and cook over a high heat until no moisure remains. Off the heat, stir in the parsley and season generously with salt, black pepper and nutmeg. Chop and set aside to cool.

Whisk the eggs and a pinch of salt until thick and creamy. Carefully fold in the flour and cooked spinach. Turn into a lined swiss-roll tin. Bake in a 200â„ƒ oven for 10-12 minutes, until set. Turn out onto a sheet of baking parchment and carefully roll into a cylinder. Leave to cool on a wire rack.

When cool, unroll and spread over the cottage cheese and chopped chives, then carefully re-roll.
