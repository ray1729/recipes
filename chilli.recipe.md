# Chilli

A quick beef chill made in the Instant Pot. I added a dried ancho chilli with the liquid, and at the end of cooking took it out, chopped it finely, and stirred back through. Might be nice with some hot smoked paprika.

### Ingredients

 * 1 tablespoon oil
 * 400 g minced beef
 * 2 each onions, chopped
 * 2 cloves garlic, crushed
 * 2 teaspoons ground cumin
 * 2 teaspoons hot chilli powder
 * 1 teaspoon cocoa powder
 * 1 tablespoon tomato puree
 * 400 g tin chopped tomatoes
 * 400 g tin red kidney beans
 * 400 ml beef stock
 * 1 each lime, squeezed
 * salt
 * black pepper

### Directions

Heat the oil on the sautee setting and brown the mince, then stir in the onions and a good pinch of salt and cook until softened, adding a slpash of water if they start to catch. Add the crushed garlic and continue cooking for another couple of minutes.

Stir in the spices, the cocoa powder, and the tomato puree, and cook out for a couple of minutes. Now stir in the tomatoes, kidney beans and stock.

Put on the lid and set to pressure cook on high for 10 minutes. Allow pressure to drop naturally for another 10 minutes before releasing the pressure.

If necessary, switch back to sautee and let it bubble for a few minutes to thicken the sauce.

Stir in the juice from the lime, check the seasoning, and serve.
