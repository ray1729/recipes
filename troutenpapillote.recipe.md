# Trout en papillote

Recipe yields 2 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 4 pieces trout fillets, unskinned
 * 4 pieces trout fillets, pin boned
 * 2 ounces butter
 * 1 tablespoons leeks (white part only), finely shredded
 * 1 tablespoons carrot, finely shredded
 * 2 ounces button mushrooms, thinly sliced
 * 1 teaspoons fresh tarragon, chopped
 * 1 teaspoons fennel leaves, chopped
 * salt
 * black pepper, freshly ground
 * lemon juice
 * 2 tablespoons dry white wine
 * oil

### Directions

Preheat oven to 220C and place a baking sheet in the oven.

Melt half the butter and add the leek and carrot.  Cook slowly without browning for 5 minutes, then add the mushrooms.  Cook for 2 more minutes, then add the tarragon (or fennel leaves) and season with salt and pepper.  Allow to cool.

Brush the inside of a large sheet of baking foil with oil, leaving the edges clear.  Sandwich the trout fillets, skin side outside, with the vegetables.  Squeeze a few drops of lemon juice on each and sprinkle on the wine.  Dot with the remaining butter and season with salt and pepper.

Fold up the baking foil to form a bag with the fish and vegetables in the middle.  Place on the baking sheet and cook for 12 minutes.

Slash the parcels then serve immediately on warmed plates.
