# Cheese Bread

Recipe yields 3 small loaves 

### Ingredients
 * 1 grams chilli powder
 * 1 grams ground cumin
 * 120 grams cheese, grated
 * 570 grams Basic Savoury Bread Dough
 * 1 pieces eggs, beaten
 * 100 grams cheese, grated

### Directions

Stir the spices into the grated cheese and add this to the savoury bread dough, folding through until evenly distributed.  Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces and shape into round balls.  Allow to relax for a minute or two then press down with your hand until they roughly double in diameter.  Place on a tray lined with baking parchment with enough space in between that they won't touch.  With a plastic scraper, make a cross in each roll, almost all the way through to the parchment, marking out each one into four quarters.

Brush with the beaten egg then sprinkle over the grated cheese.   Prove until nicely risen then bake at 190Â°C for 15-20 minutes.
