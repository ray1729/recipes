# Crème Patissière

Recipe yields 750 grams 

### Ingredients
 * 6 pieces egg yolks
 * 125 grams sugar
 * 40 grams plain flour
 * 500 milliliters milk

### Directions

Place the egg yolks and about 1/3 of the sugar in a bowl and whisk until they are pale and form a light ribbon.  Sift in the flour and mix well.

Combine the milk, the remaining sugar, and the vanilla pod in a saucepan and bring to a boil.  As soon as the mixture bubbles, pour about 1/3 onto the egg mixture, stirring all the time.  Pour the mixture back into the pan and cook over gentle heat, stirring continuously.  Boil for 2 minutes, then tip into a bowl.

Dust lightly with icing sugar to prevent a skin forming while the custard cools.
