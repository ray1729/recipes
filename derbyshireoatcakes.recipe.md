# Derbyshire Oatcakes

### Ingredients
 * 8 ounces fine oatmeal
 * 8 ounces whole-wheat or plain flour
 * 1 teaspoons salt
 * 0.5 ounces fresh yeast
 * 0.75 pints warm milk
 * 0.75 pints warm water
 * 1 teaspoons sugar

### Directions

1. Add salt to flour and oatmeal.

2. Dissolve yeast with a little warm liquid and add sugar. Allow to become frothy. 

3. Mix dry ingredients with yeast and rest of warm liquid to make a batter. 

4. Cover with clean cloth and leave in warm place for 1 hour. 

5. Bake on well-greased griddle. Put enough batter onto griddle to produce an oatcake to a diameter of your choice. 

Derbyshire Oatcakes can be around 6 or 7 inches, Staffordshire Oatcakes are more like 9 inches in diameter.

Turn oatcake after 2-3 minutes when upperside appears dry and underside is golden brown, and cook for another 2-3 minutes. 

Eat as soon as possible.
