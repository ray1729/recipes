# Lamb chops with onions, mustard and chickpea puree

Recipe yields 2 portions 

### Ingredients
 * 1 large onion, peeled
 * 2 medium onion, peeled
 * 1 tablespoons olive oil
 * 1 400g tins chickpeas
 * 1 sprigs thyme
 * 2 cloves garlic, peeled
 * 2 large lamb chump chops
 * lamb chump chops
 * 50 grams butter
 * 3 tablespoons Greek-style yoghurt
 * 6 tablespoons red wine
 * 2 tablespoons grainy Dijon mustard
 * 2 tablespoons parsley, chopped

### Directions

Cut the onions into segments from stalk to root, to give 8-10 wedges of onion.  Separate the layers and cook with the oil over a medium heat in a shallow pan.  Empty the chickpeas into a pan with the thyme and garlic, and cover with water.  Salt and simmer for 15 minutes.

When the onions are soft and starting to brown at the edges, push them over to one side of the pan and turn up the heat.  Place the chops in the pan and cook on both sides until the fat is golden and crisp, the meat browned, and the insides pink and juicy (about 4 minutes each side).

Meanwhile, drain the chickpeas, remove the thyme and mash with a potato masher.  Stir in the butter and yoghurt and season with pepper.  Lift the onions (which should be soft with slightly crisp edges) and the lamb onto warm plates.

If there is more than a film of fat in the pan, tip it away.  Pour in the red wine, scape any crusty bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spatula, and set over a high heat until the wine has reduced by half (1-2 minutes).  Stir in the mustard and most of the parsley, season with salt and pepper, and simmer for a minute or so until thoroughly hot.  Spoon the sauce over the chops and onions, then scatter over the remaining parsley.
