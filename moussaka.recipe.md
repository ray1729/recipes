# Moussaka

### Ingredients
 * 340 grams aubergine
 * salt
 * black pepper, fresh ground
 * 6 tablespoons olive oil
 * 1 large onion, finely chopped
 * 675 grams minced lamb
 * 150 milliliters white wine
 * 150 milliliters water
 * 1 cloves garlic, crushed
 * 400 grams canned tomatoes
 * 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
 * 2 teaspoons fresh oregano, chopped
 * ground cinnamon
 * 225 grams flouy potatoes, peeled
 * 200 milliliters Greek yoghurt
 * 1 pieces egg, beaten
 * 4 tablespoons Parmesan, grated

### Directions

Remove the stalk from the aubergine then cut into slices 6mm thick.  Salt the slices on both sides then leave in a colander for 30 minutes to degorge.

Place 2 tablespoons of the oil in a small saucepan, add the onion and sweat over a low heat until soft.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.

Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a saute pan and brown the mince in small batches, taking care not to overload the pan.  Mix together the wine and water and use a little to deglaze the pan between batches.  Reserve the deglacage.  Place the browned mince in a sieve over a bowl to drain off the excess fat.

Combine the onion. garlic, browned meat, tomatoes, remaining water and wine, deglacage, parsley, oregano and cinnamon in a large saucepan and simmer for 45 minutes.

Boil the potatoes until tender, drain cool and cut into slices 6mm thick.

Preheat the grill.  Rinse the aubergine slices and pat dry on absorbent kitchen paper.  Brush on both sides with the remaining oil and grill until browned.

Preheat the oven to 180C (gas 4).

Place a thin layer of the meat sauce in a shallow ovenproof dish.  Arrange a layer of aubergine slices on the sauce, then a thin layer of sauce and a layer of potatoe slices.  Continue layering, finishing with a layer of sauce.

Mix together the yoghurt, egg, and Parmesan.  Spread over the moussaka (the dish can be made 1 day in advance and refrigerated at this point).

Bake for 45 minutes, until golden brown on top and hot in the centre.
