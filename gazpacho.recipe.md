# Gazpacho

### Ingredients
 * 900 grams tomatoes, peeled
 * 1 large onion
 * 2 pieces red peppers
 * 1 small cucumber
 * 1 slices white bread, crust removed
 * 1 pieces egg yolk
 * 2 cloves garlic
 * 6 tablespoons olive oil
 * 1 tablespoons tarragon vinegar
 * 450 grams canned tomatoes
 * 1 tablespoons tomato purée
 * black pepper, fresh ground
 * sea salt

### Directions

Finely dice a small amount of the fresh tomato, onion, red pepper and cucumber and put into separate bowls for garnish.  Roughly chop the remaining vegetables to prepare them for the blender.

Put the bread, egg yolk and garlic into the blender.  Turn it on and add the oil in a thin, steady stream while the motor is runninng.  You should end up with a thick, mayonnaise-like emulsion.

Add the vinegar then gradually add all the soup ingredients in batches and blend until smooth.

Sieve the soup to remove the tomato seeds and check the seasoning.  Serve icy cold, with the small bowls of chopped vegetables and fried croûtons as garnish; optionally add crushed ice to the soup just before serving.
