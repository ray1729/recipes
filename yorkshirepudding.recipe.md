# Yorkshire pudding

Recipe yields 4 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 110 grams plain flour
 * salt
 * 2 pieces eggs, beaten
 * 290 milliliters milk
 * 4 tablespoons beef dripping
 * 2 tablespoons oil

### Directions

Sift the flour and salt into a bowl.  Make a well in the centre and add the eggs.

Beat the eggs with a wooden spoon, gradually drawing in more flour to the centre.  Add the milk little by little until the batter is smooth.  Chil for at least 30 minutes before use.

Preheat the oven to 200C/Gas 6.  Heat the oil or dripping in a Yorkshire pudding tin until very hot.

Pour in the batter.  Bake for 40 minutes, or until the pudding is risen and golden.  Yorkshire puddings baked in individual patty moulds take about 15 minutes, and 25 minutes in muffin tins.
