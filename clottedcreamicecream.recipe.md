# Clotted cream ice cream

Recipe yields 750 ml 

### Ingredients
 * 375 milliliters milk
 * 125 grams caster sugar
 * 5 pieces egg yolks
 * 125 milliliters clotted cream

### Directions

Bring the milk to the boil. Whisk together the egg yolks and caster sugar until they are rich, thick ribbons. Pour on the hot milk and stir well. Cook until it thickens to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and add the clotted cream. When it has cooled, churn in an ice-cream machine, in 2 batches if necessary, for approximately 20 minutes. Pour into a container and put into the freezer to finish setting.
