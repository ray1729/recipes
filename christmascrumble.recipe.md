# Christmas crumble

Recipe yields 4 portions 

### Ingredients
 * 400 grams apples
 * 450 grams mincemeat
 * 1 large bananas, sliced
 * 1 pieces orange, juiced
 * 100 grams flour
 * 75 grams butter
 * 50 grams demerera sugar

### Directions

Pre-heat the oven to 200C.  Slice the apples thinly (no need to peel) and place them in a 900ml pudding basin.  Stir in the mincemeat, banana slices, and the orange juice.

Rub the butter into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs, then stir in the demerera sugar.  Drizzle over a few drops of water and stir with a fork (some of the crumbs will stick together, making a pleasant crubmly rather than powdery texture).  Place on top of the fruit mixture.

Bake in the pre-heated oven for 25-30 minutes, until crisp on top.
