# Lemon & pistachio yoghurt ice

### Ingredients
 * 500 milliliters natural yoghurt
 * 100 milliliters honey
 * 1 pieces lemon, juice
 * 1 pieces lemon, grated zest
 * 2 handfuls pistachios, roughly crushed

### Directions

1. In a bowl, combine all of the ingredients. Taste for sweetness, it may be too sharp for your palate.

2. Pour into an airtight container and place into the freezer. If you have an ice cream maker, all the better as it will be done in no time.

3. For people like me who don't own an ice cream maker, there are two ways you can do it. Every hour, take a fork and beat the mixture thoroughly to break down and distribute the ice. Or you can freeze for 3-4 hours then blitz in a food processor.

4. Serve with a drizzle of honey and a sprinkling of nuts.
