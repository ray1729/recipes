# Ground rice pudding with rhubarb

### Ingredients
 * 50 grams ground rice
 * 500 milliliters milk
 * 50 grams caster sugar
 * 2 pieces egg yolk
 * 6 pieces star anise
 * 150 milliliters Whipping cream
 * 75 grams demerera sugar
 * 1 kilograms rhubarb
 * 750 milliliters white wine
 * 750 milliliters water
 * 150 grams sugar
 * 25 grams fresh root ginger, peeled

### Directions

Put the milk and the star anise in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Sprinkle in the cereal and stir constantly as it comes to the boil. Simmer very gently for 20 minutes. Whisk together the egg yolks, the sugar and a spoonful of the cream and add a little of the ground rice mixture. Whisk well and pour into the remainder, stirring constantly. Put back on the stove and continue to stir for a minute to make sure the sugar is fully dissolved. The heat of the mixture will have cooked the yolks. Remove from the heat and cool, covering the surface with a buttered paper to stop a skin forming.

Whip the cream until it forms soft peaks. When the ground rice is cool, whisk it vigorously and then fold in the cream. Pour this mixture into a pudding dish and then chill very well. Sprinkle the surface of the pudding with the demerara sugar and then caramelise it under a very hot grill or with a blowtorch.

Trim away the leaves and bases of the rhubarb and cut it into lengths as long as your little finger. Slice the ginger into thick pieces and put it with the wine and sugar into a wide saucepan. Bring gently to the boil and let it infuse for 10 minutes. Bring back to the boil and then drop in the rhubarb. As soon as the mixture comes back again to the boil, turn the rhubarb and simmer for two minutes. The rhubarb will cook quickly and must not be allowed to disintegrate. Chill. Serve a spoonful of pudding beside another of the poached rhubarb and its liquor.
