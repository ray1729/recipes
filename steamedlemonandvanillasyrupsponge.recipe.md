# Steamed lemon and vanilla syrup sponge

### Ingredients
 * 1 pieces vanilla pods
 * 1 pieces lemon
 * 140 grams unsalted butter
 * 125 grams caster sugar
 * 3 pieces eggs, lightly beaten
 * 200 grams plain flour
 * 1.5 teaspoons baking powder
 * 100 milliliters milk
 * 2 pieces Lemons, juice and grated zes
 * 200 grams caster sugar
 * 150 milliliters water

### Directions

Split the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape out the seeds. Cream together the butter, sugar, lemon zest and vanilla seeds until light and fluffy, then gradually add the beaten egg. Sift in the flour and baking powder and fold in thoroughly. Add enough milk to get a soft dropping consistency.

To make the syrup, put the lemon juice and zest in a small saucepan with the sugar, water and reserved vanilla pod. Heat gently, stirring until the sugar has dissolved, then bring to the boil and simmer until it has a syrupy consistency.

Cut the zested lemon in half widthways and trim off the bottom and top. Place the widest end of one of the lemon halves in a buttered and floured 1,2lt pudding basin and cover with the syrup, reserving a little for later. Spoon in the sponge mix. Cover with parchment or foil, and steam for about 2 hours, until well-risen and firm. Turn into a large serving bowl and pour over the last of the syrup. Serve with double cream.
