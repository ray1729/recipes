# Black sticky gingerbread

### Ingredients
 * 225 grams butter
 * 225 grams soft dark brown sugar
 * 225 grams black treacle
 * 290 milliliters milk
 * 340 grams plain flour
 * 2 teaspoons ground ginger
 * 1 tablespoons ground cinnamon
 * 2 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda
 * 2 pieces eggs, at room temperature
 * 2 pieces eggs, beaten

### Directions

Heat the oven to 150C/Gas mark 2.  Line the base and sides of a 20x30cm roasting tin with baking parchment.

Melt the butter, sugar and treacle in a saucepan.  Pour in the milk, and leave to cool to room temperature.

Sift the flour with the ginger, cinnamon, and bicarbonate of soda, then stir in the melted mixture and the beaten eggs.  Stir well and pour into the prepared tin.

Bake for about 1 hour, covering the top with greaseproof paper after 45 minutes.  It is cooked when a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.

When the gingerbread is cold, cut into fingers and store in an airtight container.
