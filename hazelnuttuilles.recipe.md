# Hazelnut Tuilles

Recipe yields 24 biscuits 

### Ingredients
 * 4 pieces egg whites
 * 50 grams caster sugar
 * 25 grams plain flour
 * 250 grams ground hazelnuts
 * 3 tablespoons hazelnut oil

### Directions

Lightly whisk the egg whites to a froth then beat in the remaining ingredients.  Chil for at least 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 180C.  Spread a small amount of mixture in templates of the desired shape on a sheet of silpat.  Bake in batches of 4-6 until light and golden brown (6-7 minutes).  Scoop off with a palette knife and transfer to a cooling rack to crisp up.

For curved tuilles, curve over a rolling pin while still hot.

Store in an airtight container.
