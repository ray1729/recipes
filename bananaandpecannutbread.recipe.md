# Banana and pecan nut bread

### Ingredients
 * 3 large ripe bananas
 * 225 grams self-raising flour
 * salt
 * 175 grams caster sugar
 * 100 grams unsalted butter, softened
 * 2 pieces eggs
 * 2 tablespoons golden syrup
 * 50 grams pecan nuts

### Directions

Pre-heat the oven to 160C/Gas 3 and grease a 2lb loaf tin.

Peel and mash the bananas in a bowl then add the remaining ingredients and beat vigorously for a minute to make sure they are well combined.  Spoon the mixture into the loaf tin, sprinkle the top with pecan nuts and bake in the pre-heated oven for 1 1/4 hours until well-risen and firm to the touch.  Leave the loaf to rest for 10-15 minutes in the tin then turn out on a cooling rack and leave to cool.  Can also be served warm as a pudding.
