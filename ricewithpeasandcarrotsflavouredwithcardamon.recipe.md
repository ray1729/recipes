# Rice with peas and carrots flavoured with cardamon

Recipe yields 6 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 2 cups Long-grain rice
 * 2 medium carrots
 * 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
 * 3 pieces cardamon pods
 * 1 inches cinnamon stick
 * 4 pieces cloves
 * 0.5 medium onion, peeled
 * 1 pints chicken stock
 * salt
 * 1.25 cups peas

### Directions

Wash the rice in several changes of water.  Drain, cover with fresh water, and leave to soak for at least 25 minutes.  Drain and leave in a strainer over the bowl.

Peel the carrots and cut into 1/4" dice.  Slice the onion into half-rounds.

Heat the oil in a medium-sized pot over a medium high flame.  When hot, put in the cardamon, cinnamon and cloves.  Stir once or twice then add the onion.  Fry until the onion browns slightly, stirring occasionally.  Add the carrots, stir, and fry for a minute, then add the drained rice.

Continue to turn and fry, turning the heat down slightly if it starts to catch, for 2 minutes or until the rice is translucent and nicely coated with oil.  Pour in the stock and salt.  Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce heat to very low and cook for 20 minutes.  Lift the cover and add the peas and cook for another 5-10 minutes until the peas are tender.  Mix gently before serving.
