# Savoy cabbage and parmesan soup with croutons

Recipe yields 4 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 6 tablespoons olive oil
 * 1 large onion, sliced
 * 1 pieces garlic clove, crushed
 * 0.5 teaspoons caraway seeds
 * 1 medium savoy cabbage
 * 1 medium potato, peeled and diced
 * 1.1 litres vegetable stock
 * Coarse sea salt
 * 0.5 pieces mild red chilli, deseeded and sliced
 * Parmesan skin
 * 80 grams Parmesan, grated
 * 8 slices baguette
 * olive oil
 * 1 medium ripe tomato
 * 2 pieces garlic cloves, peeled

### Directions

Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a large pot and saute the onion over a medium heat until soft but not coloured (about 5 minutes).  Add the garlic and caraway and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove 4 of the outer leaves of the cabbage, shred finely, and set aside.  Roughly shred the rest of the cabbage, then add to the pot along with the diced potato, and stir for 2-3 minutes.  Add enough stock to just cover the vegetables, add the Parmesan skin, reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the potato is tender.  Remove the Parmesan skin, taste the soup and season accordingly.  Remove from the heat, allow to cool for a few minutes, then blitz roughly with a hand blender or liquidizer.  Add more stock if it is too thick.  Adjust the seasoning.

For the croutons, preheat the grill to high.  Put the bread on a baking sheet and drizzle with oil.  Grill for 2 minutes a side, or until golden brown.  Grate the tomato.  Rub the croutons with the garlic, brush with tomato, and finish with a sprinkle of salt.

To serve, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan and saute the reserved cabbage with the chilli and salt.  Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the cabbage softens.  Spoon the hot soup into bowls, add the grated Parmesan (optional), top with the fried cabbage, and finish with a few extra caraway seeds scattered over the top.
