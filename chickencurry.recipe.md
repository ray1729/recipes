# Chicken curry

Recipe yields 2 portions 

### Ingredients
 * 6 pieces chicken breasts and legs, on the bone
 * 2 tablespoons groundnut oil
 * 1 medium onion, chopped
 * 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
 * 4 centimetres fresh root ginger, peeled and grated
 * 1 pieces medium-hot chilli pepper, seeded and chopped
 * 8 pieces green cardamon pods
 * 1 tablespoons ground cumin
 * 1 tablespoons ground turmeric
 * 200 milliliters chicken stock
 * 100 milliliters natural yoghurt
 * 75 milliliters double cream
 * 1 tablespoons lemon juice
 * 1 tablespoons coriander leaves, chopped

### Directions

Lightly brown the chicken in half the oil over a high heat; remove from the pan, then cook the onion, garlic and chilli in the remaining oil.

Remove the black seeds from the cardamon pods and crush them.  When the onion is soft, add the cardamon cumin and turmeric and fry over a medium heat.

Return the chicken to the pan, pour in the stock and bring to the boil.  Season with salt and pepper, cover and simmer until the chicken is cooked (about 20 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken).

When the meat is tender, turn the heat right down and stir in the yoghurt and cream.  Warm through over a low heat, then stir in the lemon juice and coriander and serve.
