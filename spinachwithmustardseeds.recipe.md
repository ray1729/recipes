# Spinach with mustard seeds

Recipe yields 6 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 1 teaspoons salt
 * 450 grams spinach leaf
 * 6 tablespoons vegetable oil
 * 6 tablespoons ghee
 * 0.5 teaspoons whole black mustard seeds
 * 1 large onion, peeled and chopped
 * 2 cloves garlic, peeled
 * 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
 * 1 teaspoons garam masala

### Directions

Drop the spinach into a large pan of boiling water to wilt.  Drain, squeeze out as much water as possible, and chop finely.  Set aside.

Heat the oil in a heavy frying pan over a medium-high flame.  When very hot, put in the mustard seeds.  As soon as they begin to pop (this takes just a few seconds), add the onion and garlic.  Lower the heat to medium and fry for 3-4 minutes, until the onions are turning very lightly brown at the edges.  Now add the spinach and continue frying for another 10 minutes.

Just before serving, add the salt and garam masala.  (At this point, some cooked, diced potatoes may be added and stirred through to reheat.)
