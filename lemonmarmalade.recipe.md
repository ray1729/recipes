# Lemon Marmalade

Recipe yields 1.8 Kilograms 

### Ingredients
 * 450 grams Lemons
 * 1.5 litres water
 * 1.125 kilograms sugar

### Directions

Halve the lemons, squeeze out and set aside the juice.

Cut the halves into quarters and scrape out all the pith, pips, and remaining flesh, and tie these in a muslin bag.  Soak the pips and pith in the water for several hours (preferably overnight).

Cut the lemon rind into thin shreds and simmer in the water with the bag of pips until tender.  Remove the pips and add the sugar and reserved juice.  Stir over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved, then increase the heat and boil rapidly until setting point is reached (105Â°C).  Allow to cool in the pan for a short time then stir to distribute the peel.  Spoon into sterilized jars and seal.
