# Marshmallows

### Ingredients
 * 350 grams caster sugar
 * 150 milliliters glucose syrup
 * 300 milliliters water
 * 7.5 pieces gelatine leaves
 * 2 medium egg whites
 * 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
 * 0.5 teaspoons salt
 * 200 grams icing sugar

### Directions

Soak gelatine leaves then place over a low heat with 250ml water, stirring until melted.  

Put sugar and glucose syrup with 50ml water in a heavy-based pan and stir well.  Bring to a boil, without stirring, until mixture reaches 121C.

Transfer egg whites to mixer with whisk attachment and beat to soft peaks.  Turn speed to low and add the hot syrup, then the warm gelatine liquid; increase to medium and beat 2 minutes, then high and beat 10 minutes.

Lower speed and add vanilla extract and salt, beat 1 minute, then spoon onto lined parchment.  Leave to set overnight at room temperature.  Cut to desired shape, leave to form a skin, then toss in icing sugar.
