# Pumpkin soup

Recipe yields 6 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 1.4 kilograms pumpkin
 * 1.4 kilograms butternut squash
 * 100 grams unsalted butter
 * 1.3 litres chicken stock, hot
 * 100 grams parmesan cheese, grated
 * 4 tablespoons double cream
 * sea salt
 * black pepper, freshly ground
 * extra virgin olive oil
 * parmesan cheese, shavings

### Directions

Cut the pumpkin into chunks, remove seeds, peel, and slice thinly.

Heat the butter in a large, heavy saucepan over a medium-high heat until it foams and turns nut brown.  Add the pumpkin, sprinkle with salt, and stir well, then turn down the heat to low.  Cover and cook gently for 15 minutes, shaking the pan from time to time.

Pour in the hot stock, increase the heat to high, and bring to the boil.  Add the parmesan and stir in, then turn the heat down to a gentle simmer.  Cook uncovered for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally so the Parmesan doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.

Puree the soup in a blender, then pass through a sieve into a clean pan.  Whick in the cream, reheat gently, taste and adjust seasoning.

Ladle into warmed bowls, drizzle over some olive oil, and top with Parmesan shavings.
