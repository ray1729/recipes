# Corned Beef

Recipe yields 3 Kilograms 

### Ingredients
 * 3 kilograms beef brisket
 * 2 liters water
 * 100 grams sea salt
 * chicken stock
 * beef stock
 * 15 grams gelatine leaves

### Directions

Check that the beef has all visible sinews removed by the butcher, leaving it in one piece.

Mix the water and salt together to form a brine. Sit the beef in the brine, ensuring it is well covered.

Leave it in a fridge to marinade for 3 days.

Remove the beef from the brine and wash well.

Bring the beef to the boil in a clean pan with the stock and simmer for approximately 3 hours, skimming off any scum that comes to the surface.

When cooked, remove the beef from the stock and allow to cool slightly.

Drain the cooking liquor through a sieve and reduce until you get a good beef flavour.

Soak the leaf gelatine in water to soften.

When you have 900ml of reduced stock, add the soaked leaf gelatine and whisk in to dissolve.

When the beef has cooled enough to handle, break it into pieces, keeping all the fatty bits.  Chop the beef into smaller pieces by hand and mix with 500ml of stock.

The beef should absorb the stock but be quite loose; add more stock if necessary.  Season with salt and black pepper.

Set in a terrine mould, individual dishes, or one large dish, add a little more stock and allow it to absorb in.  Chill to set for at least 12 hours.
