# Cream of chicken soup

### Ingredients
 * 2 pieces onions
 * 50 grams butter
 * 2 pieces chicken legs
 * 1 glasses white wine
 * 2 dessert spoons rice
 * 1 litres chicken stock
 * 1 sprigs of thyme
 * salt
 * pepper
 * 125 milliliters double cream

### Directions

Peel and slice the onions finely and stew them in the butter very gently. When they begin to soften, add the chicken legs and let them seal without taking any colour. Add the white wine, rice, the stock and a sprig of thyme and let them all simmer very gently for 45 minutes.

When the soup is cooked, remove the chicken legs and, when cooled slightly, remove the meat from the bone and any remaining sinew and gristle. Put the meat back into the soup and put all into the bowl of an electric mixer. Blend until the mixture is absolutely smooth. Put the soup back in a pan and bring gently back to a simmer. Add the double cream and then taste for seasoning; it will almost certainly need more salt and perhaps a squeeze of lemon, just to cut the richness of the cream. Serve absolutely plain.
