# Buttermilk Dinner Rolls

Recipe yields 12 rolls 

### Ingredients
 * 800 grams white bread flour
 * 570 grams buttermilk, at room temp
 * 7 grams active dry yeast
 * 14 grams salt
 * 40 grams honey
 * 1 pieces egg
 * 1 teaspoons poppy seeds
 * 1 tablespoons melted butter

### Directions

Grease and flour a 9" round springform pan.

Combine the flour, buttermilk, yeast, salt and honey in the bowl of a standing mixer.  Mix on medium till the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.

Cover and let rise till doubled in volume (dough shouldn’t bounce back when you press a finger into it).  This will take at least two hours, maybe three or more depending on the temperature of your dough and the temperature of your kitchen.

Turn the dough out onto your counter and give it a good knead.  Divide the dough into 12 equal portions (about 4 ounces each).  Form each into a tight boule by rolling it on the counter.  Spray or butter a springform pan.  Fit the boules into it, cover it with a towel and let the dough rise for an hour.

Preheat your oven to 190℃. 

Whisk the egg till it’s uniformly yellow.

When the rolls have risen again, brush them with the egg wash, sprinkle them with poppy seeds and bake them for 40 minutes (to an internal temperature of 90-93℃.  Let them rest for about 10 minutes before serving.
