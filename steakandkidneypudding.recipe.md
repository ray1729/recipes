# Steak and Kidney Pudding

Recipe yields 4 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 2 tablespoons beef dripping
 * 450 grams chuck steak, cut into 25mm dice
 * 225 grams ox kidney, cut into 25mm dice
 * 225 grams lamb's kidneys, cut into 1" pieces
 * 2 pieces carrots, cut into 10mm dice
 * 2 pieces onions, cut into 10mm dice
 * 2 sticks celery, cut into 10mm dice
 * 175 grams button mushrooms, quartered
 * 300 milliliters stout
 * 600 milliliters veal stock 
 * 1 pieces bay leaf
 * salt
 * pepper
 * For the suet pastry:
 * 300 grams self-raising flour
 * 150 grams shredded suet
 * 200 milliliters water
 * salt

### Directions

Melt dripping and brown meat in batches; set aside.  Gently fry vegetables, then add stout and reduce to 1/3.  Add meat, stock, bay leaf and seasoning; simmer 1 - 1 1/2 hours until meat is just tender.

Meanwhile, make the pastry.  Sieve the flour and salt together, add the shredded suet, and work to fine breadcrumb consistency.  Add the water and bring together as a soft, but not sticky, dough.  Wrap and rest in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.  Grease pudding basin. Roll out the pastry to 5mm thick and line the basin, reserving enough pastry for the lid.

Strain and reserve the liquid from the meat.  Fill the pudding with meat and vegetables, and just enough sauce to barely cover.  Fit the lid, then cover with parchment or buttered tin foil.  Steam for 1 1/2 hours to cook the pastry.

Strain and reduce the reserved liquid to serve as a gravy.
