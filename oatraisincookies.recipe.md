# Oat and Raisin Cookies

### Ingredients

 * 115 g unsalted butter, softened
 * 125 g light brown soft sugar
 * 1 each large egg
 * 0.5 tsp vanilla extract
 * 95 g plain flour
 * 0.5 tsp bicarbonate of soda
 * 0.5 tsp ground cinnamon
 * 0.25 tsp salt
 * 120 g rolled oats
 * 120 g raisins

### Directions

Pre-heat oven to 180℃ / 160℃ fan. Line a baking sheet with parchment.

Beat together the butter, sugar, vanilla, and egg with a hand mixer. Sift in the flour, bicarbonate of soda, and cinnamon and stir to form a dough. Add the oats and raisins and stir to combine. Wrap in cling film and chill for 10 minutes (can be frozen at this stage).

Roll dough into equal sized balls, about 2 tbsp each. Arrange on the baking sheet and flatten. Bake 10-12 minutes untill golden at the edges but still looking a little under-baked on top.

Leave on the hot baking sheet for 5-10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
