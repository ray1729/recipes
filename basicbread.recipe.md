# Basic Bread

Recipe yields 1 large loaf 

### Ingredients
 * 600 grams stoneground wholemeal flour
 * 5 grams sea salt
 * 8 grams fresh yeast
 * 400 grams water

### Directions

Mix flour and salt in a bowl.

Pour about a quarter of the water into a jug and dissolve the yeast in this, stirring with your fingers.

Pour the yeasty water into the bowl with the flour and salt and add the rest of the water.  Use one hand to hold the bowl and the other to begin mixing.  Once a dough has formed, tip it out onto the worktop and begin kneading.

Knead for 10-15 minutes.

Make sure the bowl is reasonably clean and put the dough back in it.  Cover with a polythene bag big enough not to come into contact with the dough.  Leave in a warm place.

When the dough has risen significantly (about 2 hours), knock it back by folding it over on itself a couple of times.

Grease 1 large loaf tin (or 2 small tins) and place the dough in the tin(s).

Set the bread to prove again, covered with a plastic bag to stop it drying out.

Preheat the oven to 230C.  When the dough has risen appreciably, bake for 30-40 minutes, reducing the temperature to 200C after 10 minutes.
