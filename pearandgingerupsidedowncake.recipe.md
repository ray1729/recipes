# Pear and Ginger Upside-down Cake

### Ingredients
 * 3 pieces dessert pears, peeled
 * 3 pieces dessert pears, halved and cored
 * 570 milliliters sugar syrup
 * 55 grams butter
 * 55 grams light brown sugar
 * 115 grams butter, softened
 * 115 grams dark brown sugar
 * 170 grams black treacle
 * 225 grams plain flour
 * 2 teaspoons ground ginger
 * 2 pieces eggs, beaten
 * 85 milliliters milk
 * 1 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda

### Directions

Heat the oven to 180Â°C.  Grease a 20cm round cake tin.

To make the topping, poach the pears in the sugar syrup until soft (about 30 minutes).  Cream the butter and light brown sugar together in a bowl until pale and fluffy.  Spread on the base of the prepared tin.  Place the pears, cut sides down, on top of the butter/sugar mix with the tops pointing inwards.

For the cake:

Melt the butter in a saucepan with the dark brown sugar and treacle.  Do not allow it to boil.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.

Sift the flour and ground ginger together into a large mixing bowl.  Make a well in the centre and pour in the eggs and the treacle mixture.  Carefully mix to a smooth batter.  Warm the milk gently, add the bicarbonate of soda, and pour into the batter.  Mix well, then carefully pour the batter over the pears in the tin, making sure they are not disturbed.

Bake in the oven for about 45 minutes or until a sharp knife inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.  Remove the cake from the tin and allow to cool for a few minutes, then turn upside-down onto a plate.
