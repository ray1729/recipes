# Chocolate Truffle Cream

Recipe yields 1.15 Kilograms 

### Ingredients
 * 600 grams dark chocolate
 * 200 grams double cream
 * 300 grams butter, at room temperature
 * 50 milliliters alcohol (whisky, rum, kirsch...)

### Directions

Roughly chop the chocolate and melt in a double boiler.

Pour the cream into a saucepan and boil for 2 minutes.  Set aside and cool to 35-40°C.  Pour the cooled cream onto the chocolate, whisking continuously, and beat until the mixture is completely homogenous.  Keep in a cool place until it has cooled to 20°C.

Place the butter in a bowl and beat for 3 minutes, until very light.  Still beating, incorporate the chocolate/cream mixture, a little at a time, then add the alcohol of your choice.  When the mixture is very smooth and shiny, it is ready to use.
