# Curry sauce (made with curry powder)

Recipe yields 4 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
 * 2 large onions, peeled and chopped
 * 3 medium onions
 * 2 cloves garlic, peeled
 * 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
 * 1 inches fresh root ginger, peeled
 * 1 inches fresh root ginger, finely chopped
 * 2 pieces fresh chillies, deseeded and chopped
 * 2 teaspoons medium curry powder
 * 1 cans chopped tomatoes
 * 1 cans coconut milk
 * salt
 * fresh coriander, roughly chopped

### Directions

Heat oil in a large, deep frying pan.  Add onions and a pinch of salt and fry for 3-4 minutes, then add garlic, ginger and chillies and cook for another 1-2 minutes.  Stir in the curry powder, then add the chopped tomatoes and coconut milk.  If the sauce looks too thick, add a cup of water or stock.  Stir well, bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes, until the onions are cooked.

At this point, you can add cooked meat and heat through thoroughly, or raw meat or fish cut into bite-sized pieces can be poached in the sauce.  Add more stock or water at any time during the cooking if the sauce is getting too thick.

Check the seasoning, adding salt or more curry powder if needed then, at the last minute before serving, remove from the heat and stir through the chopped coriander leaves.
