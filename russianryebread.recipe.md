# Russian rye bread

Recipe yields 1 large loaf 

### Ingredients
 * 440 grams Production rye sourdough
 * 330 grams rye flour
 * 5 grams sea salt
 * 200 grams water, at 40C

### Directions

Mix all the ingredients together thoroughly.  Using wet hands, scoop up the dough and drop it into a well-greased loaf tin (or 2 smaller ones).

Cover loosely with a polythene bag and allow to prove (this could take anything from 2-8 hours, depending on the vigour of the sourdough and the temperature.

Bake in as hot an oven as possible (230C-240C), reducing the temperature by 20C after 10-15 minutes.  Baking time for a large loaf will be 50-60 minutes, or 35-45 minutes for a small one.
