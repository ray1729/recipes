# Pikelets

Recipe yields 20 pikelets 

### Ingredients
 * 225 grams strong white bread flour
 * 1 teaspoons salt
 * 300 milliliters milk
 * 1 tablespoons corn oil
 * 0.5 teaspoons caster sugar
 * 10 grams fresh yeast
 * 0.25 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda
 * 60 milliliters warm water

### Directions

Sieve the flour and mix in the salt.

Warm the milk, corn oil and sugar until tepid and dissolve the yeast into this mixture.

Add the yeast mix to the flour and beat until smooth.

Cover with lightly oiled cling film, placing the cling film directly on top of the batter to avoid it getting a skin.  Leave to ferment for at least 1 hour in a warm area.

Dissolve the soda in the warm water and stir into the batter, then leave to ferment for a further 30 minutes.

Warm a frying pan over a medium heat with a little corn oil.

Drop a small amount of the batter into the pan using a spoon or ladle and swirl the pan around to spread the mixture evenly.  Cook over a gentle heat until the top look dry with lots of tiny holes appearing.

Turn over and continue cooking on the other side until lightly browned, then remove from the pan and allow to cool.
