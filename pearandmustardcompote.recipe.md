# Pear and Mustard Compote

### Ingredients
 * 6 pieces Conference pears, ripe
 * 6 pieces Other firm pears, ripe
 * 200 grams granulated sugar
 * 2 pieces Lemons, juice
 * 25 grams Yellow mustard seeds
 * 25 milliliters white wine vinegar

### Directions

Peel and core the pears, then cut into small dice.  Place in a pan with all the other ingredients and 50ml cold water.  Let the sugar dissolve over a low heat, stirring once or twice, then increase the heat and simmer, stirring regularly, for about an hour.  At the end, the compote should have thickened and turned a pale golden colour.

Decant into sterilized Kilner jars and seal while hot.  Cool, then keep in the fridge for upto 6 weeks.  Serve with cheese or cold meat.
