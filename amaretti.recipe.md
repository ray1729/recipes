# Amaretti

### Ingredients
 * 500 grams white marzipan
 * 150 grams caster sugar
 * 50 milliliters Amaretto liqueur
 * 400 grams icing sugar, for dusting

### Directions

Cut the marzipan into 8 pieces, place in a large bowl, and knead in the caster sugar until just combined.  Add half of the Amaretto and knead it into the paste.  Add the remaining Amaretto and bring the paste together as a ball.  Sift half the icing sugar onto a clean work surface and roll the dough into a log 5cm in diameter.  Cut slices from the log about 1cm thick.

Sift the remaining icing sugar into a bowl and roll each piece of dough, 1 at a time, into a neat ball.  Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment about 5cm apart and leave for 20 minutes.  Cup hand over each biscuit and pinch with fingers and thumb so it has 5 marks on the side.

Bake 8-10 minutes at 200C.
