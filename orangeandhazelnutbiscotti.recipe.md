# Orange and Hazelnut Biscotti

### Ingredients
 * 300 grams plain flour
 * 100 grams caster sugar
 * 0.25 teaspoons salt
 * 1 teaspoons baking powder
 * 125 grams unsalted butter, diced
 * 2 pieces eggs, lightly beaten
 * 1 pieces orange, grated zest
 * 180 grams hazelnuts, roughly chopped

### Directions

Combine flour, salt, sugar and baking powder.  Rub in butter, then stir in hazelnuts and orange zest.  Stir in eggs and bring together as a dough.  Knead gently for 1-2 minutes.

Divide into 2 pieces and form each into a log about 30cm long.  Place on a baking tray lined with parchment and gently press down with your hand until about 1.5cm thick.

Bake 30 minutes at 180C then cool for 15 minutes.

Using a serrated knife, cut at 45Â° angle into 1cm thick slices.  Place these cut side down on baking tray and return to oven for 10 minutes.  Turn over and bake for a final 10 minutes, until dry and crunchy.
