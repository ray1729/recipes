# Anjou pear cake

### Ingredients
 * 1 pounds pears
 * 1 pieces lemon, juiced
 * 1.5 cups flour
 * 1.5 teaspoons baking powder
 * salt
 * 2.5 ounces caster sugar
 * 2 large eggs
 * 2 ounces butter, melted
 * 1 tablespoons water
 * 3 tablespoons apricot jam
 * 3 tablespoons water

### Directions

Peel, core and cut up the pears, dropping them into a bowl containing the lemon joice and turning them in the juice so that they do not darken.

Mix the remaining ingredients in the order given, then fold in the pears with any juice. Turn into a lined 8" tin that has been brushed with extra melted butter.  Bake for an hour at 180C/Gas 4, or until cooked.

Make a glaze by boiling together the apricot jam and water then sieving out any lumps.

Remove the cake from the tin and brush it all over with the apricot glaze.  It can be eaten warm as a pudding, with cream if you like, as well as cold.
