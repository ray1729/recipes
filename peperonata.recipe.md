# Peperonata

### Ingredients
 * Red pepper
 * Green pepper
 * Yellow pepper
 * tomatoes
 * 1 large onion
 * 1 cloves garlic
 * olive oil
 * salt
 * pepper

### Directions

Allow 4-5 small or 1 large tomato for each pepper.

Cut the peppers into strips, discarding the stalk and seeds.  Lightly colour a large sliced onion and 1-2 cloves garlic in olive oil. Add the peppers, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.  Add the peeled and chopped tomatoes.  Boil steadily, without a lid, for 30-40 minutes, until the pepper lies in a vivid, rich tomato stew.  Season with salt, pepper, sugar (optional) and a dash of vinegar (optional).
