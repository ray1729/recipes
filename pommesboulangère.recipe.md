# Pommes boulangère

Recipe yields 4 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 400 milliliters chicken stock
 * 1 sprigs fresh thyme
 * 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
 * 5 cloves garlc, peeled
 * 2 large onions, peeled and sliced
 * olive oil
 * 4 large waxy potatoes
 * sea salt
 * black pepper, fresh ground

### Directions

Heat the oven to 200C/gas 6,  Bring the stock to the boil with the thyme, rosemary and 3 smashed garlic cloves.  Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 20 minutes, then strain.  Finely chop the remaining garlic cloves.  Sauté the onions and chopped garlic in a little olive oil until softened (6-8 minutes).  Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and slice finely using a mandoline.

Layer the potatoes and onions in a large, shallow ovenproof dish, seasoning as you go, and finishing with a neat layer of potatoes.  Pour in enough stock to come 2/3 of the way up the side of the dish.  Press down the potatoes and finally drizzle a little olive oil over the top.  Bake for about 35-40 minutes until golden brown on top and the potatoes are tender when pressed.
