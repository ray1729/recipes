### Ingredients
 * 675 grams leg of lamb, boned
 * 4 tablespoons vegetable oil
 * 4 pieces bay leaves
 * 6 pieces cardamon pods
 * 5 centimetres cinnamon stick
 * 6 pieces cloves
 * 1 medium onion, finely chopped
 * 4 cloves garlic
 * 5 centimetres fresh root ginger, peeled

 * 2 teaspoons ground coriander
 * 1 teaspoons chilli powder
 * 200 milliliters water

### Directions

Cut the lamb into 1" cubes.  Heat the oil in a medium saucepan and fry a few pieces of lamb at a time until browned.  Reheat the oil after each addition and add more oil if necessary.

Add the bay leaves, cardamon, cinnamon, cloves and onion to the pan and fry until the onion is lightly browned.

Blend the garlic, ginger and yoghurt in a food processor.  Grind the fennel to a fine powder and add to the cumin and coriander.

Add the ground spices to the onion in the pan and cook for 1 minute.  Add the lamb and any juices and stir until well mixed.  Add the yoghurt mixture, chilli powder, water and salt to taste, and bring slowly to the boil.  Cover the pan, lower the heat, and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Just before serving, add the garam masala and paprika and heat through.
