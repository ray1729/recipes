# Pear tarte tatin with spiced caramel

Recipe yields 8 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 140 grams plain flour
 * 30 grams ground rice
 * salt
 * 115 grams cold butter, cut into 1/2" cubes
 * 1 pieces egg, beaten
 * 115 grams granulated sugar
 * 55 milliliters warm water
 * 1 pods star anise
 * 1 pieces cinnamon stick
 * 30 grams cold butter
 * 1 kilograms firm, ripe pears

### Directions

To make the pastry: sieve the flour, ground rice and salt into a large bowl.  Rub in the butter, then add the egg to make a dough.  Gather into a flat disk and wrap in clingfilm.  Chill.

To make the caramel: place the sugar, water and spices into a thick-based saucepan and melt the sugar over a low heat.  When the sugar has dissolved, turn the heat to high and cook until it is a rich caramel.  Remove from the heat and carefully add the butter.  Pour into a warmed tarte tatin dish and remove the spices.

Heat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.

Peel and halve the pears, removing the stalks and core.  Place rounded-side down on the caramel.  Roll the pastry into a circle large enough to cover the dish; lift on top of the pears, trim, and tuck in the edges.

Bake it the top third of the oven for 30 minutes, until the pastry is golden-brown and cooked through.  Carefully invert onta a lipped serving dish while still hot.
