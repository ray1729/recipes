# Buttermilk Cornbread

Recipe yields 1 10" skillet 

### Ingredients
 * 1 tablespoons rendered bacon fat
 * 1.5 cups white cornmeal (or yellow)
 * 0.25 cups all-purpose flour
 * 2 teaspoons sugar (optional)
 * 1 teaspoons salt
 * 1 teaspoons baking soda
 * 0.25 cups canola oil
 * 1.5 cups cultured buttermilk
 * 1 large egg

### Directions

Start by preheating your oven to 450°F/230°C. Once it’s ready, add the bacon fat to the skillet and put it into the oven to preheat. You’ll want to give the pan at least 10-15 minutes to get hot, so take your time.

Whisk all the dry ingredients together until well mixed and any lumps of baking soda have disappeared. The small amount of sugar in this recipe isn’t enough to sweeten the bread, but if you’re in the “No Sugar in Cornbread!” camp, or cooking for someone who is, leave it out.

In a separate bowl, thoroughly mix the wet ingredients, then add to the dry ingredients and mix until they just come together. Remove the hot pan from the oven–the bacon fat should be smoking slightly. Carefully pour the batter into the pan, then put the pan back into the oven.

Bake for 18 minutes or so, until the bread is set and slightly browned. Remove the pan from the oven and let it cool about five minutes.
