# Pork and pears

Recipe yields 2 portions 

### Ingredients
 * 2 pieces pork chops
 * 2 tablespoons groundnut oil
 * 2 cloves garlic, crushed
 * 2 pieces pears, cut into 8 and cored
 * 1 glasses dry white wine
 * 1 glasses vermouth
 * 75 milliliters stock

### Directions

Season the chops with salt and pepper.  Heat the oil in a shallow pan with the crushed garlic colves.  When hot, slide in the chops and seal on both sides.

Turn down the heat, add the pears, and cook until tender and browned lightly, about 10 minutes.  Remove the chops and pears to warm plates.

Pour most of the fat from the pan and return to the heat.  Pour in the wine or vermouth and deglaze the pan, scraping away any bits of pork or pear stuck to the pan.  Add the stock and simmer the pan juices until reduced by half.  Pour over the pork chops and pears.
