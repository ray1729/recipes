# Jamie Oliver's Pumpkin Soup

### Ingredients
 * 3 kilograms pumpkin
 * 3 kilograms butternut squash
 * 2 pieces Red onions, peeled
 * 2 sticks celery
 * 2 pieces carrots, peeled
 * 2 cloves garlic
 * rosemary
 * 2 litres chicken stock
 * Sage leaves
 * olive oil

### Directions

Remove the seeds from the pumpkin and roughly chop.  Roughly chop the vegetables.

Heat olive oil in the bottom of a pressure cooker and add the onions and celery.  After a minute or so, add the carrots and garlic.  Add some small rosemary leaves and season with salt and pepper.

Add the squash and chicken stock to come up to 1" from the top, put the lid on the pressure cooker, and bring up to pressure.  Cook 6 minutes, release steam, and check that the squash is cooked.

Blend until smooth and check seasoning.

Serve with crispy sage leaves, crunchy croutons, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
