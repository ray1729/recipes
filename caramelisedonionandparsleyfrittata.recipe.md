# Caramelised onion and parsley frittata

Recipe yields 4 portions 

### Ingredients
 * 450 grams onions, peeled and sliced
 * 4 tablespoons olive oil
 * 5 pieces eggs
 * flat-leaf parsley, coarsely chopped
 * 50 grams parmesan cheese, grated
 * 1 knobs butter

### Directions

Put the onions in a shallow pan with the olive oil and cook over a medium heat stirring occasionally until they are golden, tinged with dark brown and almost blackened at the edges (15-25 minutes).

Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.  Remove the onions from the pan with a slotted spoon and stir them into the eggs.  Season with salt and pepper, and add the parsley and parmesan cheese.

Heat the butter in a shallow, heavy-based non-stick pan, and tip in the egg mixture.  Cook on the lowest setting until the egg has set on the bottom but the surface is still runny (about 15 minutes).  Flash the pan under a pre-heated grill to set the uppermost surface.  Loosen witha palette knife then slide out onto a warm plate, cut into wedges and serve.
