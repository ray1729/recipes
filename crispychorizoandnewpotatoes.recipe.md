# Crispy chorizo and new potatoes

Recipe yields 4 portions 

### Ingredients
 * 500 grams new potatoes, scrubbed
 * 3 pieces chorizo sausages
 * 3 sprigs fresh rosemary, finely chopped
 * 2 tablespoons Dry Madeira

### Directions

Boil the potatoes until cooked but still firm (8-10 minutes).  Remove from the heat and cool under cold running water, then cut in half lengthways on the diagonal and set aside.

Heat a large, non-stick frying pan to hot and cook the chorizo sausages for 2-3 minutes, until the oils are released.  Add the potatoes and rosemary and cook, stirring frequently, over a high heat for a further 2-3 minutes until golden and crispy.

Reduce the heat and add the Madeira.  Stir and leave to caramelize and brown for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
