# Date and walnut granary bread

Recipe yields 6 baguettes 

### Ingredients
 * 250 grams strong white bread flour
 * 750 grams granary flour
 * 1 teaspoons salt
 * 50 grams fresh yeast
 * 25 grams dried yeast
 * 100 grams unsalted butter
 * 100 grams demerera sugar
 * 600 milliliters milk
 * 150 grams chopped walnuts
 * 150 grams chopped dates

### Directions

Sieve the strong flour, mix with the granary flour and set aside in a warm place. Warm the milk with a pinch of caster sugar, add the yeast, mix well, and set aside to let the yeast activate.

Brown the butter by placing in a frying pan and heating until it turns golden brown and smells slightly nutty.  Take off the heat immediately and leave to cool.  Add the demerera sugar, chopped walnuts and dates.

Add the walnuts, dates, sugar and butter to the flours and mix well.  Gradually add the yeasted milk until a soft, slightly sticky dough is formed.  Knead well then set aside to prove in a warm place.

Knock back the dough and knead slightly, then roll into baguette shapes.  With a sharp knife, slash across the bread at an angle about 5mm deep.

Brush with egg wash and sprinkle liberally with strong white flour.  Allow to prove until doubled in size, then bake in an oven at 180C for about 30 minutes.
