# Curried parsnip soup

### Ingredients
 * 1 tablespoons coriander seeds
 * 1 teaspoons cumin seeds
 * 0.5 teaspoons chilli flakes
 * 1 teaspoons ground turmeric
 * 0.25 teaspoons ground fenugreek
 * 1 medium onion, chopped
 * 1 cloves garlic, split
 * 1 large parsnips, peeled and sliced
 * 2 tablespoons butter
 * 1 tablespoons flour
 * 1 liters beef stock
 * 150 milliliters double cream
 * chives, chopped
 * parsley, chopped

### Directions

Roast the spices then whizz together in a coffee mill or pound in a mortar.

Cook the onion, garlic and parsnips gently in the butter, lid on the pan, for 10 minutes.  Stir in the flour and 1 tablespoon of the spice mixture and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Gradually add the stock then leave to cook until the parsnip is really tender (20-30 minutes).

Puree in a blender and dilute to taste with water.  Correct the seasoning.  Reheat, add the cream and serve scattered with chives or parsley.
