# Caramel Sauce

Recipe yields 700 ml 

### Ingredients
 * 80 milliliters water
 * 100 grams sugar
 * 500 milliliters double cream
 * 2 pieces egg yolks, lightly beaten

### Directions

Pour the water into a large saucepan and add the sugar.  Set over a low heat until the sugar has completely melted and is beginning to boil.  Wash down the inside of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water to prevent crystals from forming.   Cook the sugar until it turns deep amber and the surface starts to smoke slightly.  Take the pan off the heat immediately and beat in the cream, stirring constantly with a whisk.

Set the pan back over a high heat and stir with the whisk.  Let the mixture bubble for 2-3 minutes then remove from the heat.

(Optional: stir a little of the sauce onto the egg yolks, then return the mixture to the pan but do not cook it.)

Pass the sauce through a strainer into a bowl and keep in a cool place, stirring from time to time to prevent a skin from forming.
