# Spice Cake

### Ingredients
 * 500 grams caster sugar
 * 200 grams plain flour
 * 150 grams ground almonds
 * 25 grams liquorice powder
 * 25 grams ground cinnamon
 * 25 grams star anise
 * 25 grams ground ginger
 * 25 grams ground cardamom
 * 1 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda
 * 500 grams unsalted butter, melted and heated to
 * 100 grams honey
 * 8 pieces egg whites

### Directions

Mix together all the dry ingredients in a bowl. Add the butter and honey and mix well. Then add the egg whites and mix again to combine. Cover and leave in the fridge to chill for at least an hour.

Preheat oven to 180C (gas 4)

Grease 8-9cm rings with butter or oil and place on a non-stick baking tray. Fill the rings with the spice cake mixture and bake for 9-11 minutes or until a cake will spring back when lightly pressed in the middle. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Remove from the rings before serving. (This makes more than four cakes, the rest will keep in an airtight tin for up to a week).
