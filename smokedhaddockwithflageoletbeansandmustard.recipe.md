# Smoked haddock with flageolet beans and mustard

### Ingredients
 * 400 grams smoked haddock
 * butter
 * 250 milliliters milk
 * bay leaves
 * 2 400g tins flageolet beans
 * 300 milliliters double cream
 * 1 handfuls flat-leaf parsley
 * 1 tablespoons grainy Dijon mustard

### Directions

Remove the skin from the smoked haddock and place the fish in a lightly buttered baking dish.  Pour over the milk, then enough water to almost cover the fish.  Tuck in a couple of bay leaves and grind over some black pepper.  Bake at 200C/Gas 6 for 15-20 minutes, or until you can pull out one of the large, flat flakes of flesh with ease.  Drain and discard the milk.

Rinse and re-butter the baking dish.  Rinse the beans in a sieve under running water, then empty them into a mixing bowl.  Pour in the cream and a couple of tablespoons of milk, then chop the parsley and add it together with the mustard, a grinding of black pepper, and a little salt (go easy on the salt, as the smoked fish is saltier than fresh).

Spoon the beans into the dish and lay the fish on top, spooning over some of the creamy beans to keep it moist.  Turn the oven down to 180C/Gas 4 and bake for about 40 minutes, until the cream is bubbling and the sauce has thickened around the beans.

Serve with steamed spinach.
