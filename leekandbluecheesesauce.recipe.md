### Ingredients
 * 3 large leeks, washed and trimmed
 * 2 tablespoons olive oil
 * 50 grams fresh breadcrumbs
 * 300 milliliters cream
 * 180 grams blue cheese

Cook the leeks whole in boiling water until just tender.  Drain, wrap in a tea towel and press with a weight for 10 minutes.

Preheat oven to 160C.  Heat oil in a pan and fry breadcrumbs until golden brown, turning constantly.  Drain, season, and keep warm in the oven.
