# Pork and lemon polpettine

Recipe yields 4 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 70 grams fresh white breadcrumbs
 * 500 grams pork mince
 * 1 pieces lemon
 * parsley, roughly chopped
 * 6 sprigs thyme
 * 2 tablespoons parmesan cheese, grated
 * 10 pieces anchovy fillets, chopped
 * flour
 * 2 tablespoons olive oil
 * 40 grams butter
 * 200 milliliters chicken stock

### Directions

Put the breadcrumbs and pork in a mixing bowl and grate in the lemon zest.  Halve the lemon and squeeze.  Add the lemon juice to the pork with the parsley and the thyme leaves stripped from their stems.  Tip in the parmesan and the chopped anchovy fillets.  Season with a little salt and black pepper, and mix thoroughly.

Make about 18 small balls of the mixture, using a heaped tablespoon of pork for each one, and place on a floured baking sheet.

Warm the olive oil and butter in a heavy-based pan.  Roll the patties lightly in the flour on the baking sheet, then fry them in the oil about 8 at a time, for 4-5 minutes, until they are crisply golden on each side.  Lower the heat and leave to cook through to the middle - a matter of 6-8 minutes more.  Turn them no more than once or twice durning cooking, so they develop a crisp, slightly sticky exterior.

Tip the fat from the pan then pour in the chicken stock.  Leave to bubble for 2-3 minutes, scraping and stirring the pan stickings.  Let the stock bubble down a bit, then divide the patties between 4 plates and spoon over the juices from the pan.
