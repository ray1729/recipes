# Asparagus Risotto

### Ingredients
 * 600 grams asparagus
 * 1 pieces onion
 * 50 grams unsalted butter
 * 400 grams risotto rice
 * 250 milliliters prosecco or other dry white wine
 * 500 milliliters chicken stock
 * 50 grams parmesan cheese, finely grated

### Directions

Wash the asparagus well. Cut off the tips so they are two or three centimetres long and cut off the stalks at the base where they have no greenness to them and are very woody. Without peeling the asparagus, cut them diagonally into thin slices no thicker than a pound coin. Peel and chop the onion very finely.

Bring the chicken stock to a simmer and briefly poach the asparagus tips for a minute before lifting out with a slotted spoon. Melt half the butter in a heavy saucepan and add the onion, letting it soften gently for two or three minutes before adding the asparagus.

Turn this briefly in the butter and then add the rice. Stir this in turn until it starts to catch on the sides or base of the pan and then pour in all the prosecco. Season with a teaspoon of sea salt and a good milling of black pepper and stir occasionally until the wine has become completely absorbed. Now start to add, ladle by ladle, the hot chicken stock, stirring the risotto from time to time. Continue this process for the next 12 minutes; once the chicken stock is used up, add boiling water if necessary, checking the rice, making sure that, while being cooked through, it remains firm and slightly nutty to the bite.

To finish, add the cooked tips, the remaining butter and a couple of tablespoons of Parmesan and stir in on the heat.

Make sure the risotto has a nice fluid consistency without being soupy. Serve immediately, sprinkling the remaining Parmesan on each portion.
