# Chocolate Amaretti

### Ingredients
 * 75 grams ground almonds
 * 125 grams caster sugar
 * 1 tablespoons cocoa
 * 0.25 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda
 * 0.25 teaspoons almond extract
 * 2 pieces egg whites
 * icing sugar, for dusting

### Directions

Put all the ingredients, save for the icing sugar, into a bowl and, using a wooden spoon, mix until evenly combined. Line one or two baking trays with non-stick baking parchment (or buttered sheets of foil), then spoon small, 2-3cm blobs of almond paste spaced 2-3cm apart all over the paper. Sift a generous dusting of icing sugar over the amaretti, then leave, uncovered, overnight at room temperature.

The following day preheat the oven to 220C (fan-assisted). Squish each blob of almond paste inward with your fingers, then bake for 10-12 minutes, until a rich, golden brown. Remove from the oven and leave to cool on the tray.
