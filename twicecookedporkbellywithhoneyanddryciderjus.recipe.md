# Twice-cooked pork belly with honey and dry cider jus

### Ingredients
 * 2 kilograms belly pork
 * 2 litres chicken stock
 * 2 litres water
 * 300 grams mixed chopped onions, carrots, leeks celery
 * 4 cloves garlic
 * 5 sprigs fresh thyme
 * 1 pieces star anise, optional
 * 200 milliliters dry cider
 * 250 milliliters recuded stock from cooking the belly
 * 1 teaspoons clear honey
 * 25 grams unsalted butter, diced

### Directions

Place the chopped vegetables, garlic, thyme and star anise in the bottom of a roasting tray.  Place the pork belly on top of the vegetables and pour over the chicken stock or water to come 1/3 to 1/2 of the way up the pork. Cover tightly in tin foil and place in a pre-heated oven (160C) for 3-4 hours, or until you can see the pork is very soft and tender.

When the pork has cooked, put it to one side and allow to cool.  Strain the stock into a saucepan, bring to the boil, and reduce to about 250ml, skimming off any scum or fat that comes to the surface.

When the pork is cool enough to handle, remove any bones (they should pull out easily) and trim away any sinew.  Wrap tightly in cling-film and refrigerate overnight with a heavy weight on top.

To serve: preheat oven to 230C; rub the skin of the pork with salt, cut the pork belly pork into portion-sized squares.  Place on a non-stick mat and roast in the hot oven for 10-15 minutes, until the skin is puffed-up and crisp.

For the sauce: put the cider in a saucepan, bring to the boil, and reduce until it is thick and syrupy.  Add the stock, bring to the boil, and reduce a little further.  Stir in the honey.  Whisk in the cold butter a little at a time to enrich the sauce.  Serve immediately.
