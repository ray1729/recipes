# Coq au vin

Recipe yields 4 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 1.35 kilograms chicken, jointed into 8
 * 290 milliliters red wine
 * 1 cloves garlic, peeled and bruised
 * 1 pieces boquet garni
 * 8 pieces button onions
 * 100 grams rindless bacon, cut into lardons
 * 55 grams clarified butter
 * 12 pieces button mushrooms
 * salt
 * black pepper, fresh ground
 * 570 milliliters white chicken stock
 * 1 cloves garlic, crushed
 * 20 grams plain flour
 * 1 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped

### Directions

Place the chicken pieces in a large plastic bag with the wine, bruised garlic and boquet garni.  Tie the top and refrigerate overnight.

To remove the skin from the onions, blanch them in boiling water for 1 minute, then refresh in cold water.  Trim the roots level with the bulbs, then peel.

Blanch the bacon in boiling water for 30 seconds to remove the excess salt; drain and dry well.

Put half the butter into a large, heavy saucepan and brown the onions, bacon and mushrooms.  Remove from the pan and reserve.

Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving the marinade and boquet garni, and discarding the garlic.  Pat the chicken dry and season with salt and pepper.

Add the remaining butter to the pan and brown the chicken on the skin side oven a medium/low heat.  Tip off all the fat and reserve.

Return the vegetables and bacon pieces to the pan and add the wine from the marinade and enough stock nearly to cover the chicken pieces.  Add the crushed garlic and boquet garni.

Cover with a piece of damp greaseproof paper and a tightly fitting lid and simmer slowly for about 45 minutes, until the onions and chicken are tender.

Discard the boquet garni.  Lift out the vegetables and bacon and put them onto a warmed serving dish.  Keep warm while you make the sauce.  Place the cooking liquid in a jug and reserve.

Mix the flour with enough of the reserved fat to make a roux.  Cook the roux in a small pan over a medium heat until light brown.

Off the heat, pour the cooking liquid into the roux, taking care to leave the fat behind (use a bulb baster). 

Return to the heat, bring to the boil, and boil for 2 minutes.  Adjust the thickness to sauce consistency by boiling further or adding water as required.  Taste and adjust the seasoning.

Trim the chicken pieces, arrange on the serving dish, then pour oven the sauce.  Garnish with the chopped parsley.
