# Boiled bacon with pease pudding

Recipe yields 6 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 1.4 kilograms gammon
 * 1.4 kilograms hock bacon
 * 2 pieces bay leaves
 * 3 pieces cloves
 * 5 pieces black peppercorns
 * 2 medium onions, roughly chopped
 * 3 medium carrots, roughly chopped
 * 5 sticks celery, roughly chopped

### Directions

Soak the bacon in cold water for a couple of hours to remove excess salt; alternatively, place in a saucepan, cover with cold water, and slowly bring to the boil, then drain and discard the water.

Cover the bacon with fresh cold water and add the ingredients for the stock, and the pease pudding.  Bring slowly to the boil, skimming the surface when needed, then cover with a lid and simmer gently until cooked (25 minutes per 455g plus 25 minutes).
