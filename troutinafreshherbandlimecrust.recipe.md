# Trout in a fresh herb and lime crust

Recipe yields 2 portions 

### Ingredients
 * 4 large trout fillets
 * 3 pieces limes
 * 2 tablespoons fresh breadcrumbs
 * 2 tablespoons dill weed, chopped
 * 2 tablespoons parsley, chopped
 * 25 grams butter

### Directions

Pre-heat oven to 200C.  Check that all bones have been removed from the fish.

Finely grate the two of the limes and add their zest to the herbs and breadcrumbs; add a little salt.

Melt the butter in a small pan and add the juice from the two grated limes.  Put the herb mixture on a flat plate and press the fillets down firmly on one side so that the herbs stick to the fish.

Bake in the pre-heated oven for about 8 minutes, until the crumbs are golden.  Garnish with the remaining lime, cut in half.
