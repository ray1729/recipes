# Pickled Red Cabbage

### Ingredients

 * 500 grams red cabbage, finely shredded
 * 1 tablespoon coarse salt
 * 500 millilitres cider vinegar
 * 200 millilitres red wine
 * 300 grams sugar
 * 2 tablespoons black peppercorns
 * 6 bay leaves
 * 2 tablespoons yellow mustard seeds

### Directions

Rub the salt into the cabbage, place in a colander, and leave for 2-3 hours. Rinse off the salt
and pat the cabbage dry with a tea towel.

Put the vinegar, sugar, wine, peppercorns, and bay leaves in a pan, bring to a boil, and simmer
until the liquid has reduced by half. Strain to remove the peppercorns and bay leaves.

Mix together the mustard seeds and cabbage and pack into sterilized jars. Pour over the pickling liquor.
