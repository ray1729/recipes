# Swiss chard with carrots

Recipe yields 4 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 3 tablespoons olive oil
 * 1 cloves garlic
 * 1 pieces dried red chillies
 * 400 grams Swiss chard
 * 3 pieces carrots
 * salt
 * pepper

### Directions

Warm olive oil in the pan, with chilli and garlic; before the garlic browns remove from heat and take out the garlic. Wash chard, separate leaves from the stems and then cut the leaves into large pieces. Peel carrots, slice thinly on the diagonal, then into narrow strips.
 
 In a large pan of boiling water, briefly cook chard stems and carrots until tender. Cook the chard leaves quickly in water and drain in a colander and then press the leaves with a wooden spoon to remove excess water. Mix all the vegetables together and season with salt and pepper. Dress with the chilli and garlic oil. This can be served hot or at room temperature with the optional splash of vinegar or lemon juice.
