# Cr√®me Anglaise (2)

Recipe yields 1.55 litres 

### Ingredients
 * 12 pieces egg yolks
 * 250 grams sugar
 * 1 litres milk
 * 1 pieces vanilla pods, split

### Directions

Put the egg yolks in a bowl with 85g of the sugar and beat with a whisk until the mixture forms a ribbon.

Combine the milk, vanilla pod and remaining sugar in a saucepan and bring to the boil.  Pour the boiling milk onto the egg mixture, whisking continuously.  Pour the mixture back into the pan, set over a low heat and cook, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon, until the mixture is thick enough to coat it.

Pass through a conical strainer and keep in a cool place until completely cold, stirring from time to time to prevent a skin from forming.
