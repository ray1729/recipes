# Crème Caramel

Recipe yields 6 portions 

### Ingredients
 * 3 pieces eggs
 * 2 pieces egg yolks
 * 100 grams caster sugar
 * 500 milliliters milk
 * 1 pieces vanilla pods
 * 100 grams caster sugar
 * 2 tablespoons water

### Directions

Lightly grease 6 dariol moulds.

First make the caramel: heat the sugar gently, stirring until it has melted.  Increase heat and make an amber caramel, then remove from heat and add the water.  Stir thoroughly, and pour immediately into the prepared moulds.

Split the vanilla pod along its length and scrape out the seeds.  Add to the milk along with the pod.  Bring to a boil.   Meanwhile, whisk together eggs and sugar.  Pour the hot milk onto the eggs, stirring continuously.  Strain through a fine sieve then pour into the prepared moulds.

Place in a tray and fill with hand-hot water to come 2/3 of the way up the moulds.  Bake in a 170℃ oven for 20-25 minutes, until just set.
