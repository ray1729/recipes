# Braised shoulder of lamb

### Ingredients
 * 1 pieces shoulder of lamb, on the bone
 * 20 pieces shallots, peeled
 * 20 cloves garlic, peeled
 * olive oil
 * thyme
 * rosemary
 * 0.5 bottles white wine
 * 1 litres chicken stock
 * sea salt
 * black pepper

### Directions

In an oven tray deep and winde enough to house your shoulder of lamb, brown the shallots and garlic in the oil. Lay the bundle of joy in the pan and put the shoulder of lamb on top. Pour on the white wine and stock. Season liberally.

Cover with foil and place in a gentle oven (160â„ƒ) for 3-ish hours, as always keeping an eye on it and poking it with a small, sharp knife to check if it's done. As far as cooking meat goes, shoulder of lamb is one of the best-behaved joints and you don't even have to know how to carve. It is a case of attack.
