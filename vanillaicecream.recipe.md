# Vanilla Ice Cream

Recipe yields 2 litres 

### Ingredients
 * 12 pieces egg yolk
 * 200 grams caster sugar
 * 600 milliliters milk
 * 600 milliliters cream
 * 6 pieces vanilla pods

### Directions

Add milk and cream with a tablespoon of the sugar to a large pan.  Split vanilla pods and scrape with the seeds into the pan, and add the pods.  Heat gently.

Whisk egg yolks and sugar until light and creamy.  Gradually add warm milk, whisking continuously to avoid the eggs from scrambling.  Return to a clean pan and cook until the eggs have thickened (but not scrambled) - 85C.

Pass through a sieve into a bowl in an ice bath.

Churn in the ice cream machine.
