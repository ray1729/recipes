# Buttermilk Pannacotta

Recipe yields 4 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 300 milliliters double cream
 * 300 milliliters buttermilk
 * 50 grams sugar
 * 1 pieces vanilla pods
 * 3 pieces gelatine leaves

### Directions

Split the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape out the seeds; add with the pod and the sugar to the cream, bring to a boil, then remove from the heat and allow to cool for 1/2 hour.

Meanwhile soak the gelatine leaves in cold water.  When the cream has cooled, squeeze out the gelatine leaves and whisk into the cream.  Stir in the buttermilk.  Strain into individual ramekins or pudding moulds and leave to set in the refrigerator (allow at least 4 hours).

To serve freestanding, stand the pudding moulds in a bowl of hot water for a few seconds than upturn to free the pannacotta.

Serve with stewed fruit, e.g. gooseberries or rhubarb.
