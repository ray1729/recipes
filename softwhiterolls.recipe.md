# Soft White Rolls

Recipe yields 64 dinner rolls 

### Ingredients
 * 1.5 kilograms strong white bread flour
 * 45 grams salt
 * 1,150 grams milk
 * 150 grams butter
 * 40 grams fresh yeast
 * 50 grams fennel seeds
 * 120 grams butter, melted

### Directions

If making the fennel buns, melt the butter and cook the fennel seeds for a few minutes, until they give off a pleasant aroma.  Otherwise, melt the butter gently as you warm the milk.  Whisk the yeast into the milk, add to dry ingredients along with the butter, and knead for 10 minutes with the dough hook.  Prove, then shape into 60g dinner rolls (or 120g sandwich rolls), prove again, then bake at 190Â°C for 12-15 minutes.

Brush with the melted butter and return to the oven for 2 minutes.
