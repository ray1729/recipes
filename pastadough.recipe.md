# Pasta dough

### Ingredients
 * 225 grams double-zero pasta flour
 * 25 milliliters olive oil
 * 2 small eggs
 * 1 pieces egg yolk
 * nutmeg, grated
 * salt

### Directions

Sieve the flour into a bowl.  Mix together the eggs, olive oil, nutmeg and salt.  Vigorously mix into the flour to form a dough, then knead well until smooth.

Divide into 4 or 6 balls (depending on how long you want the finished pasta to be), wrap each ball individually and rest in the fridge for at least 1 hour.

Roll each ball through a pasta machine to the desired thickness.  If making tagliatelli, allow to dry before rolling through cutter.  Shape the pasta, then allow to dry before cooking.
