# Steamed Rhubarb Sponge

Recipe yields 24 portions 

### Ingredients
 * 1 kilograms rhubarb, cut into 1cm pieces
 * 100 grams sugar
 * 1 pieces vanilla pods, split
 * 600 grams unsalted butter
 * 500 grams caster sugar
 * 12 pieces eggs
 * 600 grams self-raising flour
 * salt

### Directions

Seal the rhubarb, sugar and vanilla pod in a vacuum pack bag and allow to macerate overnight.  Cook in a water bath at 64°C for 20-30 minutes, until cooked but still firm.  Strain off the liquid and reduce to make a light syrup.

To make the sponge, cream the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy.  Gradually whisk in the eggs, then fold in the flour and salt to form a soft but not runny batter.

Spoon 30g cooked rhubarb and 90g sponge mix into lined dariol moulds.  Cover with a parchment and tin foil lid.  Steam for 45-60 minutes, until a knife inserted in the centre of a pudding comes out clean.

To serve, pour over a little of the warmed syrup and serve with Crème Anglaise.
