# Baked Custard

### Ingredients
 * 25 pieces egg yolks
 * 175 grams caster sugar
 * 250 milliliters milk
 * 1.5 litres cream
 * 1 pieces vanilla pods

### Directions

Split vanilla pod and scrape seeds into cream and milk in a large pan; add the vanilla pod too.  Warm gently without boiling.

Whisk together the egg yolks and caster sugar until doubled in volume.  Whisk in the warmed cream.  Strain into a baking tray and cook at 95C for 50-60 minutes, until set.

[Also used as custard for bread and butter pudding; for marmalade bread and butter pudding, added 100ml whisky rather than vanilla pod to flavour the custard.]
