# Crème Chantilly

Recipe yields 600 grams 

### Ingredients
 * 500 milliliters double cream
 * 50 grams icing sugar
 * 1 pieces vanilla pods, split
 * 150 grams plain chocolate
 * 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, sifted
 * 1 tablespoons milk, hot
 * 2 teaspoons instant coffee

### Directions

Combine the well-chilled cream with the sugar and vanilla seeds in the chilled bowl of a mixer.  Beat at medium speed for 1-2 minutes.  Increase the speed and beat for 3-4 minutes, until the cream begins to thicken.  Do not overbeat - it should be a little firmer than the ribbon stage.

For Chocolate Chantilly:

If using cocoa powder, add it when you beat the cream.  Otherwise, melt the chocolate above a pan of gently simmering water, remove from the heat and mix in 1/3 of the plain Crème Chantilly.  Gently fold this into the remaining Chantilly.

For Coffee Chantilly:

Dissolve the coffee in the hot milk and leave to cool.  Add it when you beat the cream.
