# Pasta with cream and mushrooms

### Ingredients
 * 1 heads garlic
 * 1 tablespoons olive oil
 * 2 sprigs thyme
 * 125 grams pasta
 * 150 milliliters double cream
 * 100 grams mushrooms

### Directions

Set the oven to 200C (gas 6).  Trim any long stems from the garlic then put the bulbs, whole and unpeeled, in a baking dish, drizzle with olive oil and scatter over some of the thyme.  Roast until the cloves are soft and virtually caramelised (30-40 minutes).

Tear the heads apart and squeeze out the cloves from their skins, and mash to a pulp.

Put a large, deep pan of water on to boil and cook the pasta.  Melt some butter in a saute pan and, when foaming, toss in the mushrooms and cook.  Warm the creamed garlic in a pan over a moderate heat, then pour in the cream and let it bubble briefly before crumbling in a little salt, some ground black pepper, the rest of the thyme leaves stripped from their branches, and the cooked mushrooms.

Drain the pasta, leaving behind a little of the cooking water; toss gently into the sauce.
