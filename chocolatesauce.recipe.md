Recipe yields 460 grams 

### Ingredients

 * 2 tablespoons double cream
 * 30 grams sugar
 * 30 grams butter

### Directions

Melt the chocolate over a pan of gently simmering water.

Place the milk, cream and sugar in a saucepan and set over high heat.  Stir gently with a whisk until the mixture boils.  Pour it onto the melted chocolate, stirring all the time.  Tip all the mixture into the saucepan and let in bubble for 15 seconds.
