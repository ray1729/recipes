# Trotter Gear

### Ingredients
 * 6 pieces pig's trotters
 * 2 pieces onions, peeled
 * 2 pieces carrots, peeled
 * 2 sticks celery
 * 2 pieces leeks, cleaned
 * 1 heads garlic
 * 1 bundles thyme
 * black peppercorns
 * 0.5 bottles Sercial Madeira
 * chicken stock

### Directions

Clean the hair from the trotters. Place in a large casserole, cover with water, and bring to the boil. Boil for 5 minutes then drain. This removes the initial scum given off by the trotters.

Now place the blanched trotters back in the casserole with the vegetables, peppercorns, thyme, and Madeira. Add enough chicken stock to cover. Cover and place in a gentle (160â„ƒ) oven for at least 3 hours, until the trotters are totally giving. At this point, strain the cooking liquor and keep. When the trotters have cooled enough to handle (but don't let them go cold, as they become much harder to deal with) pick off all the flesh, fat and skin off them, tearing the skin into shreds. Add to the cooking liquor, seal in a jar, and refrigerate.
