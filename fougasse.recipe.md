# Fougasse

Recipe yields 6 fougasses 

### Ingredients
 * 10 grams fresh yeast
 * 5 grams dried yeast
 * 3 grams fast-action dried yeast
 * 500 grams strong bread flour
 * 10 grams salt
 * 350 milliliters water
 * 200 grams white flour

### Directions

Preheat the oven to 250℃.

Rub the yeast into the flour. Add the salt and water, and mix to combine. Leave to stand for 10 minutes to allow the flour to absorb the water.

Knead until smooth, form into a ball, and return to a clean, oiled bowl. Cover with cling film and rest in a warm place for 1 hour.

Flour your work surface well. Gently ease the dough from the bowl, taking care not to knock out any air. Cut in half, then cut each half into three roughly-equal rectangles.

To shape each fougasse: make a large diagonal cut across the centre, then three smaller cuts fanning out from each side. Gently open up the cuts to form holes.

Lift onto a lightly-floured baking tray and transfer immediately to the hot oven. Mist the inside of the oven with a water spray. Close the oven door, turn the heat down to 230℃, and bake until golden brown (10-12 minutes).

Variations: after kneading, but before resting the dough, you can mix in some halved olives, roasted peppers or onions, or rosemary or thyme leaves.
