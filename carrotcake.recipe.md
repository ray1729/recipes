# Carrot cake

Recipe yields 1 7"x11" cake 

### Ingredients
 * 9 ounces carrots, finely grated
 * 3 pieces eggs
 * 6 ounces raw brown sugar
 * 4.5 fluid ounces oil
 * 6 ounces self-raising flour
 * 1.5 teaspoons ground cinnamon
 * 0.75 teaspoons ground nutmeg
 * 3 ounces Desiccated coconut
 * 3 ounces raisins
 * Cream cheese icing

### Directions

Pre-heat oven to 190C.  Grease and line a 7"x11" cake tin.

Whisk the eggs and sugar together until thick and creamy.  Whisk in the oil slowly, then add the remaining ingredients and mix together to combine evenly.

Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and level the surface.  Bake for 25-30 minutes, until firm to the touch and golden brown.

Leave to cool on a wire tray, and spread the top with the cream cheese icing when cold.
