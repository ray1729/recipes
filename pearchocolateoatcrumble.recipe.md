# Pear and Chocolate Oat Crumble

This is a simplification of a recipe from Nigel Slater: he slightly 
caramelizes the pears in butter and sugar, but I skipped that step. I 
halved the amount of sugar added to the pears as mine were very sweet, 
and I used a full 100g bar of dark chocolate (Menier 70%).
