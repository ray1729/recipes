# Pear and Walnut Salad

### Ingredients
 * 2 pieces ripe juicy comice pears
 * 1 pieces lemon
 * 1 tablespoons white wine vinegar
 * salt
 * 1 teaspoons grain mustard
 * 6 tablespoons walnut oil
 * freshly ground black pepper
 * roquette
 * fresh walnut halves, roughly crushed
 * 75 grams Roquefort

### Directions

Peel and core the pears, then smear with a little lemon juice to prevent them turning brown.

Put the vinegar and a good pinch of salt in a screw-top jar and shake until the salt has desolved. Add the mustard and walnut oil, then shake again to emulsify - the emulsion will hold for ten minutes or so, but give it another jiggle just before you use it to dress the salad.

Assemble the salad: slice the pears lengthwise into thin segments and place them rustically on four serving plates along with the roquette, then scatter over the bruised walnuts. Drizzle with the vinaigrette. Crumble the Roquefort over the salad, then 'dust' with a little ground black pepper.
