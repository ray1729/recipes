# Red onion and sweet potato rösti

### Ingredients
 * 2 pieces red onion, finely sliced
 * 1 cloves garlic, finely chopped
 * 750 grams sweet potatoes, peeled and grated
 * 1 pieces egg, beaten
 * 15 grams butter, melted
 * black pepper
 * salt
 * olive oil
 * butter

### Directions

Heat a little olive oil in a wide heavy-based frying pan and sauté until softened, adding the garlic after a couple of minutes.  Tip into a bowl and allow to cool.  Wrap the grated potatoes in a clean cloth and squeeze out the excess liquid.  Mix with the sautéed onions, beaten egg, melted butter and seasoning.

Heat a little olive oil and a knob of butter in the frying pan.  Using one or more 10cm greased plain metal cutters, shape the sweet potatoe mixture into neat cakes in the pan, pressing down the mixture in the rings.  Cook over a medium/low heat for about 5-6 mintues, until the underside is golden brown, then remove the rings and flip over with a palette knife.  Cook the other side for 2-3 minutes until crisp.  Drain the rösti on kitchen paper and keep warm while cooking the remaining mixture.
