# Baba Ghanoush

Recipe yields 2 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 1 pieces aubergine
 * 1 pieces garlic clove, crushed
 * 0.5 pieces lemon, juice
 * 1.5 tablespoons olive oil
 * 1 tablespoons tahini paste
 * salt
 * freshly ground black pepper

### Directions

Pre heat the oven to 220â„ƒ. Prick the aubergine skin all over and place on a baking tray or dish. Place in the oven for about 45 -60 mins until the aubergine is soft. Set aside to cool. Once cooled enough to handle, peel off the skin, scrape any left inside the skin so all the flesh is removed. Place in a bowl with any juice from the aubergine and beat until fairly smooth.
