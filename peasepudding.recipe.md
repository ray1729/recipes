# Pease pudding

Recipe yields 6 servings 

### Ingredients
 * 340 grams yellow split peas, soaked overnight
 * 1 small potato, peeled
 * 1 small onion
 * 1 pieces shallot
 * 1 cloves garlic, peeled
 * 1 small bunch of herbs (rosemarry, sage, thyme, bay)
 * 2 pieces cloves
 * 30 grams butter
 * salt
 * black pepper, freshly ground

### Directions

Rinse the soaked peas.  Add the potato, onion, garlic, herbs and cloves, and cover with cold water.  Bring to the boil, cover and simmer slowly for about 1 1/2 hours, until tender.  Drain, remove the herbs and the cloves, then add the butter, salt and pepper, and mash well.

This can also be cooked with boiled bacon, by tying all the ingredients in a piece of muslin and simmering with the bacon from the start of cooking.
