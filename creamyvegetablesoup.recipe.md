# Creamy vegetable soup

### Ingredients
 * 30 grams butter
 * 225 grams onions, thinly sliced
 * 225 grams leeks, thinly sliced
 * 1 heads celery, thinly sliced
 * 1 large potato, peeled
 * 1 large potato, thinly sliced
 * 570 milliliters white stock
 * salt
 * white pepper, fresh ground
 * nutmeg
 * 290 milliliters creamy milk
 * 1 tablespoons single cream

### Directions

Melt the butter in a very large, heavy saucepan.  Stir in the onions, leeks and celery and sweat covered with a damp piece of greaseproof paper and a lid on.  Stir occasionally, until the whole mass is soft (about 45 minutes).

Add the potatoes and stock, bring to the boil, stirring, and boil for 1 minute.  Add the salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste and simmer gently for 20 minutes.

Liquidize the soup in a blender or food processor and pass through a sieve.

Reheat and add the cream.  Warm the milk and combine with the vegetables.
