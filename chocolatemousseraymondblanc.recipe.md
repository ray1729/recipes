# Chocolate Mousse (Raymond Blanc)

### Ingredients
 * 165 grams dark chocolate
 * 240 grams egg whites
 * 40 grams caster sugar

### Directions

Melt the grated chocolate in a 20cm bowl set over a pan of simmering water, for 10 mins or so. Then turn the heat off. 

In an electric mixer on medium speed, whisk the egg whites and sugar until they form soft but firm peaks.

Remove the bowl of melted chocolate from the bain-marie, place it next to the bowl of egg white and have a whisk ready by its side. Now you must work fast. Scoop a third of the egg white into the melted chocolate and abruptly and with no mercy whisk the egg white in; this will lighten the chocolate mixture for further incorporation of the egg white.

Now you take your time. Delicately fold in the remaining egg white using the spatula. Your chocolate mousse is now ready. 

Pour into a serving bowl or individual glasses, as you wish, and leave to set in the fridge for 2 hours or until required.

This recipe is best prepared 2 - 8 hours in advance and kept covered in the fridge. It will be at its eating best up to 1 day.
