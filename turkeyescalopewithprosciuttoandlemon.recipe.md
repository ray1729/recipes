# Turkey escalope with prosciutto and lemon

Recipe yields 3 portions 

### Ingredients
 * 6 pieces turkey breast steaks
 * 6 slices prosciutto
 * 6 slices lemon
 * flour
 * 2 tablespoons olive oil
 * 100 milliliters dry white wine
 * 50 grams butter
 * flat-leaf parsley, chopped

### Directions

Bat out the turkey breast steaks with your fist to a thickness of about 5mm.  Place a slice of prosciutto on each, folding it over to fit.  Place a slice of lemon on each escalope and secure with a cocktail stick.  Dust with a little flour on both sides.

Heat the oil in a shallow pan over a high heat.  Place the escalopes in the oil and fry for about 2 minutes on each side.  When they are golden brown, tip out the oil and place the pan back on the heat.  Pour in the wine, then let most of the liquid evaporate.

Leift the escalopes out onto warm plates, drop the butter into the pan, still over the heat, and swoosh it around.  When the butter and remaining juices have mingled into a rough sauce, pour it over the escalopes and scatter over the parsley.
