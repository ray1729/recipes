# Lancashire hot pot

### Ingredients
 * 900 grams middle neck of lamb
 * 3 pieces lamb's kidneys
 * 900 grams potatoes
 * salt
 * black pepper, fresh ground
 * 2 teaspoons fresh thyme, chopped
 * 2 large onions, thinly sliced
 * 2 pieces carrot, sliced
 * 1 pieces bay leaf
 * 570 milliliters brown stock
 * 55 grams butter

### Directions

Preheat the oven to 180C/gas 4.

Cut the meat into chops, discarding most of the fat.  Skin, split and quarter the kidneys.

Wash and peel the potatoes and slice about 5mm thick.

Butter a casserole dish and line it with a layer of potatoes; season well with salt, pepper and thyme.

Layer the chops, sliced onions. carrots,  and kidneys on top of the potatoes, seasoning well with salt, pepper and thyme, and adding the bay leaf when the casserole is half full.  Finish with a neat layer of potatoes.

Pour in enough stock to come up to the bottom of the top layer of potatoes.  Brush the top with melted butter and season well.

Cover and cook for about 2 hours.  Remove the lid and cook for a further 30-40 minutes, until the potatoes are brown on top and the meat is tender.
