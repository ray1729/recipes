# Squashy rhubarb cake

### Ingredients
 * 55 grams butter
 * 85 grams plain flour
 * 30 grams sugar
 * 85 grams butter, softened
 * 85 grams sugar
 * 2 small eggs
 * 85 grams self-raising flour
 * salt
 * milk
 * 675 grams rhubarb, cut into 1" pieces
 * 2 tablespoons sugar
 * icing sugar

### Directions

Preheat the oven to 180C/Gas 4.  Grease and line a deep 20cm/8" cake tin.

First make the crumble topping: rub the butter into the flour and stir in the sugar.  Set aside.

Now make the cake: cream the butter until soft.  Add the sugar and beat until very pale, light and fluffy.  Lightly beat the eggs and add them to the sugar mixture, beating in a little at a time and adding a spoonful of the flour if the mixture curdles.  Fold in the rest of the flour and add a little milk if the mixture is too stiff; it should be of a dropping consistency.

Turn the mixture into the prepared tin and level the surface with a spatula.  Covery carefully with the raw rhubarb pieces amd the sugar.  Sprinkle with the crumble mixture.

Bake for about 45 minutes, or until the cake feels firm on top.  Leave to cool in the tin.

Just before serving, remove from the tin and sift a thin layer of icing sugar over the top.
