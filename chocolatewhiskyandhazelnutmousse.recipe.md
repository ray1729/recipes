# Chocolate, Whisky and Hazelnut Mousse

### Ingredients
 * 300 milliliters double cream
 * 200 grams 70% proof chocolate
 * 50 grams soft brown sugar
 * 2 pieces eggs, separated
 * 2 tablespoons whisky
 * 2 handfuls hazelnuts, toasted and chopped

### Directions

1 - Heat up the double cream in a thick bottomed pan along with 1 handful of the hazelnuts. Break up the chocolate and add to the cream along with the sugar. Stir until completely dissolved then pour through a sieve into a separate bowl.
2 - Allow to cool slightly. Stir in the whisky and egg yolks thoroughly.
3 - Whisk the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Beat in roughly one third of the egg whites, and then gently fold in the remaining.
4 - Tip into your glass of choice. Cover with foil or shrink-wrap and allow to set in the fridge for at least 2 hours. They will keep for a couple of days.
5 - When ready to serve, sprinkle with a few of the chopped roasted hazelnuts.
