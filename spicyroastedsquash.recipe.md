# Spicy roasted squash

### Ingredients
 * 1 medium butternut squash
 * 1 medium onion squash
 * 2 teaspoons coriander seeds
 * 2 teaspoons dried oregano
 * 0.5 teaspoons fennel seeds
 * 2 small dried red chillies
 * 1 teaspoons salt
 * 1 teaspoons black pepper, fresh ground
 * 1 cloves garlic
 * 1 tablespoons olive oil

### Directions

Wash the squash, then cut it in half and remove the seeds with a large spoon.  Cut the squash lengthways into quarters then cut in half again to end up with wedges about 1" thick.

Pound together all the dried herbs and spices in a pestle and mortar, then add the salt and pepper and pound to a fine powder.  Add the garlic clove and pound it into the spices.  Scrape out into a bowl and add the olive oil.  Toss the squash in the herb and spice mixture, making sure a;; the pieces are well coated.

Place the squash skin-side down in a baking tray and roast at 200C/Gas 6 for about 30 minutes, or until tender.
