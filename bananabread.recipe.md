# Banana Bread

### Ingredients
 * 85 grams butter
 * 225 grams plain flour
 * 3 teaspoons baking powder
 * 0.25 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda
 * 0.25 teaspoons salt
 * 0.25 teaspoons grated nutmeg
 * 225 grams ripe bananas, peeled weight
 * 110 grams caster sugar
 * 2 pieces eggs, beaten
 * 100 grams walnuts, roughly broken

### Directions

Grease a 10x10cm loaf tin and line the base with baking parchment. Preheat the oven to 190â„ƒ.

Melt the butter, then allow to cool. Sift together the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, salt, and nutmeg. Mash the bananas in a mixing bowl and stir in the sugra, eggs, and melted butter. Sift the flour mixture on top and fold in. Stir in the walnuts.

Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin. Bake for 45-60 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool for 10 minutes in the tin before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
