# Black Christmas Cake

### Ingredients
 * 250 grams currants
 * 150 grams prunes, chopped in quarters
 * 125 grams dark raisins
 * 2 pieces oranges, grated zest
 * 200 grams glac√© cherries
 * 500 milliliters Guinness
 * 500 milliliters Ale
 * 200 grams unsalted butter
 * 1 teaspoons ground cinnamon
 * 1 teaspoons ground mace
 * 1 teaspoons ground cloves
 * 1 teaspoons ground nutmeg
 * 200 grams muscovado sugar
 * 175 grams treacle
 * 2 pieces eggs
 * 200 grams spelt flour
 * 200 grams wholemeal flour
 * 0.75 teaspoons baking powder

### Directions

Combine the dried fruit, zest and cherries in a bowl. Slowly bring the stout to a boil in a large saucepan, then simmer for 15 minutes until reduced to 150ml. In another saucepan, melt the butter, then simmer until it stops spluttering and the bits on the bottom begin to turn golden. Remove from the heat, stir in the spices and leave to cool.

Add the sugar to the stout pot, heat until dissolved, then pour into the butter pan. Whisk until the buttery sediment dissolves into the liquid, then beat in the treacle and pour over the fruit in the bowl. Beat the eggs and stir them through the fruit.

Sift the flour and baking powder together, and beat into the mixture. Cut three discs and strips of baking parchment to line the base and sides of a round 20cm tin, tip in the mixture and cover loosely with foil. Bake for an hour at 170C/ 325F/gas mark 3, remove the foil and bake at 140C/275F/ gas mark 1 for a further 45 minutes to an hour, until a skewer inserted comes out clean.
