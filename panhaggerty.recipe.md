# Pan Haggerty

### Ingredients
 * 0.5 pieces onion, thinly sliced
 * 1 tablespoons vegetable oil
 * 1 pieces floury potato, thinly sliced
 * salt
 * pepper
 * 1 tablespoons goose fat
 * 1 tablespoons lard
 * 1 tablespoons vegetable oil
 * cheddar cheese, grated

### Directions

1 - Pre-heat the oven to 200C/Gas 6.
2 - In an ovenproof frying pan, heat up the vegetable oil and cook the onion for 5 minutes until softened and beginning to caramelise. Remove and set aside on kitchen towel.
3 - Wipe the pan clean, place back onto the heat then add your fat of choice. Place a chef's ring into the pan and add a layer of potatoes, making a neat ring. Add some of the cooked onions then salt and pepper. Continue in this fashion until you have filled the chef's ring.
4 - Spoon over some of the melted fat. Cover with foil then place on a high shelf in the oven. Cook for 25-30 minutes. Remove the foil. Test the potato with a sharp knife, it should glide in easily.
5 - Put the grill on high. Sprinkle a little grated cheese onto the potato then place under the grill until golden and bubbly. Run a knife around the edge then plate. These will keep in the fridge for 2 days.
